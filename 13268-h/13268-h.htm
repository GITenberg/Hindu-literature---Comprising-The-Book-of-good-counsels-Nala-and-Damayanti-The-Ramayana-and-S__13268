<a name='THE_BOOK_OF_GOOD_COUNSELS'></a><h2>THE BOOK OF GOOD COUNSELS</h2>
<h4>SELECTED FROM</h4>

<h2>THE HITOPADE&#346;A</h2>

<h4>[<i>Translated from the Sanscrit by Sir Edwin Arnold</i>]</h4>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<a name='TRANSLATORS_PREFACE'></a><h4>TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE</h4>

<p>A story-book from the Sanscrit at least possesses the minor merit of
novelty. The &quot;perfect language&quot; has been hitherto regarded as the
province of scholars, and few of these even have found time or taste to
search its treasures. And yet among them is the key to the heart of
modern India&mdash;as well as the splendid record of her ancient Gods and
glories. The hope of Hindostan lies in the intelligent interest of
England. Whatever avails to dissipate misconceptions between them, and
to enlarge their intimacy, is a gain to both peoples; and to this end
the present volume aspires, in an humble degree, to contribute.</p>

<p>The &quot;Hitopade&#347;a&quot; is a work of high antiquity, and extended popularity.
The prose is doubtless as old as our own era; but the intercalated
verses and proverbs compose a selection from writings of an age
extremely remote. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and the textual Veds are of those
quoted; to the first of which Professor M. Williams (in his admirable
edition of the &quot;Nala,&quot; 1860) assigns a date of 350 B.C., while he claims
for the &quot;Rig-Veda&quot; an antiquity as high as B.C. 1300. The &quot;Hitopade&#347;a&quot;
may thus be fairly styled &quot;The Father of all Fables&quot;; for from its
numerous translations have come &AElig;sop and Pilpay, and in later days
Reineke Fuchs. Originally compiled in Sanscrit, it was rendered, by
order of Nushirav&aacute;n, in the sixth century, A.D., into Persic. From the
Persic it passed, A.D. 850, into the Arabic, and thence into Hebrew and
Greek. In its own land it obtained as wide a circulation. The Emperor
Acbar, impressed with the wisdom of its maxims and the ingenuity of its
apologues, commended the work of translating it to his own Vizir, Abdul
Fazel. That minister accordingly put the book into a familiar style, and
published it with explanations, under the title of the &quot;Criterion of
Wisdom.&quot; The Emperor had also suggested the abridgment of the long
series of shlokes which here and there interrupt the narrative, and the
Vizir found this advice sound, and followed it, like the present
Translator. To this day, in India, the &quot;Hitopade&#347;a,&quot; under other names
(as the &quot;Anv&aacute;ri Suhaili&quot;<a name="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>), retains the delighted attention of young
and old, and has some representative in all the Indian vernaculars. A
work so well esteemed in the East cannot be unwelcome to Western
readers, who receive it here, a condensed but faithful transcript of
sense and manner.</p>

<p>As often as an Oriental allusion, or a name in Hindoo mythology, seemed
to ask some explanation for the English reader, notes have been
appended, bearing reference to the page. In their compilation, and
generally, acknowledgment is due to Professor Johnson's excellent
version and edition of the &quot;Hitopade&#347;a,&quot; and to Mr. Muir's &quot;Sanscrit
Texts.&quot;</p>

<p>A residence in India, and close intercourse with the Hindoos, have given
the author a lively desire to subserve their advancement. No one listens
now to the precipitate ignorance which would set aside as &quot;heathenish&quot;
the high civilization of this great race; but justice is not yet done to
their past development and present capacities. If the wit, the morality,
and the philosophy of these &quot;beasts of India&quot; (so faithfully rendered by
Mr. Harrison Weir) surprise any vigorous mind into further exploration
of her literature, and deeper sense of our responsibility in her
government, the author will be repaid.</p>

<h2>THE BOOK OF GOOD COUNSELS</h2>

<a name='BOGC_INTRODUCTION'></a><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<h4><b>Honor to Gunesh, God of Wisdom</b></h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This book of Counsel read, and you shall see,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fair speech and Sanscrit lore, and Policy.</span><br />
</div>
<p>On the banks of the holy river Ganges there stood a city named
Pataliputra. The King of it was a good King and a virtuous, and his name
was Sudarsana. It chanced one day that he overheard a certain person
reciting these verses&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Wise men, holding wisdom highest, scorn delights, as false as fair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Daily live they as Death's fingers twined already in their hair.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Truly, richer than all riches, better than the best of gain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wisdom is, unbought, secure&mdash;once won, none loseth her again.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bringing dark things into daylight, solving doubts that vex the mind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like an open eye is Wisdom&mdash;he that hath her not is blind.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>Hearing these the King became disquieted, knowing that his own sons were
gaining no wisdom, nor reading the Sacred Writings,<a name="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> but altogether
going in the wrong way; and he repeated this verse to himself&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Childless art thou? dead thy children? leaving thee to want and dool?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Less thy misery than his is, who is father to a fool.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>And again this&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;One wise son makes glad his father, forty fools avail him not:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One moon silvers all that darkness which the silly stars did dot.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;And it has been said,&quot; reflected he&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Ease and health, obeisant children, wisdom, and a fair-voiced wife&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus, great King! are counted up the five felicities of life.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For the son the sire is honored; though the bow-cane bendeth true,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let the strained string crack in using, and what service shall it do?&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; mused the King, &quot;I know it is urged that human efforts
are useless: as, for instance&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;That which will not be, will not be&mdash;and what is to be, will be:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Why not drink this easy physic, antidote of misery?&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;But then that comes from idleness, with people who will not do what
they should do. Rather,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Nay! and faint not, idly sighing, 'Destiny is mightiest,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sesamum holds oil in plenty, but it yieldeth none unpressed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah! it is the Coward's babble, 'Fortune taketh, Fortune gave;'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fortune! rate her like a master, and she serves thee like a slave.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;For indeed,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Twofold is the life we live in&mdash;Fate and Will together run:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two wheels bear life's chariot onward&mdash;will it move on only one?&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;And</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Look! the clay dries into iron, but the potter moulds the clay:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Destiny to-day is master&mdash;Man was master yesterday.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;So verily,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Worthy ends come not by wishing. Wouldst thou? Up, and win it, then!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While the hungry lion slumbers, not a deer comes to his den.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>Having concluded his reflections, the Raja gave orders to assemble a
meeting of learned men. Then said he&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Hear now, O my Pundits! Is there one among you so wise that he will
undertake to give the second birth of Wisdom to these my sons, by
teaching them the Books of Policy; for they have never yet read the
Sacred Writings, and are altogether going in the wrong road; and ye know
that</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Silly glass, in splendid settings, something of the gold may gain;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And in company of wise ones, fools to wisdom may attain.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>Then uprose a great Sage, by name Vishnu-Sarman, learned in the
principles of Policy as is the angel of the planet Jupiter himself, and
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;My Lord King, I will undertake to teach these princes Policy, seeing
they are born of a great house; for&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Labors spent on the unworthy, of reward the laborer balk;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like the parrot, teach the heron twenty times, he will not talk.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;But in this royal family the offspring are royal-minded, and in six
moons I will engage to make your Majesty's sons comprehend Policy.&quot;</p>

<p>The Raja replied, with condescension:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;On the eastern mountains lying, common things shine in the sun,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And by learned minds enlightened, lower minds may show as one.&quot;</span><br />

<p>&quot;And you, worshipful sir, are competent to teach my children the rules

<p>So saying, with much graciousness, he gave the Princes into the charge
of Vishnu-Sarman; and that sage, by way of introduction, spake to the
Princes, as they sat at ease on the balcony of the palace, in this
wise:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Hear now, my Princes! for the delectation of your Highnesses, I purpose
to tell the tale of the Crow, the Tortoise, the Deer, and the Mouse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pray, sir,&quot; said the King's sons, &quot;let us hear it.&quot;</p>

<p>Vishnu-Sarman answered&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;It begins with the Winning of Friends; and this is the first verse of
it:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Sans way or wealth, wise friends their purpose gain&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Mouse, Crow, Deer, and Tortoise make this plain.&quot;</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sans way or wealth, wise friends their purpose gain&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Mouse, Crow, Deer, and Tortoise make this plain.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;However was that?&quot; asked the Princes.</p>

<p>Vishnu-Sarman replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;On the banks of the Godavery there stood a large silk-cotton-tree, and
thither at night, from all quarters and regions, the birds came to
roost. Now once, when the night was just spent, and his Radiance the
Moon, Lover of the white lotus, was about to retire behind the western
hills, a Crow who perched there, 'Light o' Leap' by name, upon
awakening, saw to his great wonder a fowler approaching&mdash;a second God of
Death. The sight set him reflecting, as he flew off uneasily to follow
up the man's movements, and he began to think what mischief this
ill-omened apparition foretold.</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;For a thousand thoughts of sorrow, and a hundred things of dread,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By the wise unheeded, trouble day by day the foolish head.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>And yet in this life it must be that</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Of the day's impending dangers, Sickness, Death, and Misery,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One will be; the wise man waking, ponders which that one will be.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>Presently the fowler fixed a net, scattered grains of rice about, and
withdrew to hide. At this moment &quot;Speckle-neck,&quot; King of the Pigeons,
chanced to be passing through the sky with his Court, and caught sight
of the rice-grains. Thereupon the King of the Pigeons asked of his
rice-loving followers, 'How can there possibly be rice-grains lying here
in an unfrequented forest? We will see into it, of course, but We like
not the look of it&mdash;love of rice may ruin us, as the Traveller was
ruined.</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;All out of longing for a golden bangle,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Tiger, in the mud, the man did mangle.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;How did that happen?&quot; asked the Pigeons.</p>
<br />

<h4><b>The Story of the Tiger and the Traveller</b></h4>

<p>&quot;Thus,&quot; replied Speckle-neck: &quot;I was pecking about one day in the Deccan
forest, and saw an old tiger sitting newly bathed on the bank of a pool,
like a Brahman, and with holy kuskus-grass<a name="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> in his paws.</p>

<p>'Ho! ho! ye travellers,' he kept calling out, 'take this golden bangle!'</p>

<p>Presently a covetous fellow passed by and heard him.</p>

<p>'Ah!' thought he, 'this is a bit of luck&mdash;but I must not risk my neck
for it either.</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Good things come not out of bad things; wisely leave a longed-for ill.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nectar being mixed with poison serves no purpose but to kill.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>'But all gain is got by risk, so I will see into it at least;' then he
called out, 'Where is thy bangle?'</p>

<p>The Tiger stretched forth his paw and exhibited it.</p>

<p>'Hem!' said the Traveller, 'can I trust such a fierce brute as thou
art?'</p>

<p>'Listen,' replied the Tiger, 'once, in the days of my cub-hood, I know I
was very wicked. I killed cows, Brahmans, and men without number&mdash;and I
lost my wife and children for it&mdash;and haven't kith or kin left. But
lately I met a virtuous man who counselled me to practise the duty of
almsgiving&mdash;and, as thou seest, I am strict at ablutions and alms.
Besides, I am old, and my nails and fangs are gone&mdash;so who would
mistrust me? and I have so far conquered selfishness, that I keep the
golden bangle for whoso comes. Thou seemest poor! I will give it thee.
Is it not said,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Give to poor men, son of K&ucirc;nti&mdash;on the wealthy waste not wealth;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Good are simples for the sick man, good for nought to him in health.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Wade over the pool, therefore, and take the bangle,'</p>

<p>Thereupon the covetous Traveller determined to trust him, and waded into
the pool, where he soon found himself plunged in mud, and unable to
move.</p>

<p>'Ho! ho!' says the Tiger, 'art thou stuck in a slough? stay, I will
fetch thee out!'</p>

<p>So saying he approached the wretched man and seized him&mdash;who meanwhile
bitterly reflected&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Be his Scripture-learning wondrous, yet the cheat will be a cheat;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be her pasture ne'er so bitter, yet the cow's milk will be sweet.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And on that verse, too&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Trust not water, trust not weapons; trust not clawed nor horned things;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Neither give thy soul to women, nor thy life to Sons of Kings.'</span><br />
</div>
<p>And those others&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Look! the Moon, the silver roamer, from whose splendor darkness flies</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With his starry cohorts marching, like a crowned king through the skies.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All the grandeur, all the glory, vanish in the Dragon's jaw;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What is written on the forehead, that will be, and nothing more,'</span><br />
</div>
<p>Here his meditations were cut short by the Tiger devouring him. &quot;And
that,&quot; said Speckle-neck, &quot;is why we counselled caution.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, yes!&quot; said a certain pigeon, with some presumption, &quot;but you've
read the verse&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Counsel in danger; of it</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Unwarned, be nothing begun.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But nobody asks a Prophet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Shall the risk of a dinner be run?'</span><br />
</div>
<p>Hearing that, the Pigeons settled at once; for we know that</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Avarice begetteth anger; blind desires from her begin;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A right fruitful mother is she of a countless spawn of sin.'</span><br />
</div>
<p>And again,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Can a golden Deer have being? yet for such the Hero pined:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When the cloud of danger hovers, then its shadow dims the mind.'</span><br />
</div>
<p>Presently they were caught in the net. Thereat, indeed, they all began
to abuse the pigeon by whose suggestion they had been ensnared. It is
the old tale!</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Be second and not first!&mdash;the share's the same</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If all go well. If not, the Head's to blame.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>And we should remember that</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Passion will be Slave or Mistress: follow her, she brings to woe;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lead her, 'tis the way to Fortune. Choose the path that thou wilt go.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>When King Speckle-neck heard their reproaches, he said, &quot;No, no! it is
no fault of his.</p>

<p>'When the time of trouble cometh, friends may ofttimes irk us most: For
the calf at milking-hour the mother's leg is tying-post.'</p>

<p>'And in disaster, dismay is a coward's quality; let us rather rely on
fortitude, and devise some remedy. How saith the sage?</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;In good fortune not elated, in ill-fortune not dismayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ever eloquent in council, never in the fight affrayed&mdash;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Perfect virtues in the nature of a noble soul are met.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whoso hath them, gem and glory of the three wide worlds<a name="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> is he;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Happy mother she that bore him, she who nursed him on her knee.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;Let us do this now directly,&quot; continued the King: &quot;at one moment and
with one will, rising under the net, let us fly off with it: for indeed</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Small things wax exceeding mighty, being cunningly combined:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Furious elephants are fastened with a rope of grass-blades twined.'</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;And it is written, you know,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Let the household hold together, though the house be ne'er so small;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Strip the rice-husk from the rice-grain, and it groweth not at all.'</span><br />
</div>
<p>Having pondered this advice, the Pigeons adopted it; and flew away with
the net. At first the fowler, who was at a distance, hoped to recover
them, but as they passed out of sight with the snare about them he gave
up the pursuit. Perceiving this, the Pigeons said,</p>

<p>&quot;What is the next thing to be done, O King?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A friend of mine,&quot; said Speckle-neck, &quot;lives near in a beautiful forest
on the Gundaki. Golden-skin is his name&mdash;the King of the Mice&mdash;he is the
one to cut these bonds.&quot;</p>

<p>Resolving to have recourse to him, they directed their flight to the
hole of Golden-skin&mdash;a prudent monarch, who dreaded danger so much that
he had made himself a palace with a hundred outlets, and lived always in
it. Sitting there he heard the descent of the pigeons, and remained
silent and alarmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Friend Golden-skin,&quot; cried the King, &quot;have you no welcome for us?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, my friend!&quot; said the Mouse-king, rushing out on recognizing the
voice, &quot;is it thou art come, Speckle-neck! how delightful!&mdash;But what is
this?&quot; exclaimed he, regarding the entangled net.</p>

<p>&quot;That,&quot; said King Speckle-neck, &quot;is the effect of some wrong-doing in a
former life&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Sickness, anguish, bonds, and woe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spring from wrongs wrought long ago,'<a name="FNanchor5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></span><br />
</div>
<p>Golden-skin, without replying, ran at once to the net, and began to gnaw
the strings that held Speckle-neck.</p>

<p>&quot;Nay! friend, not so,&quot; said the King, &quot;cut me first these meshes from my
followers, and afterwards thou shalt sever mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am little,&quot; answered Golden-skin, &quot;and my teeth are weak&mdash;how can I
gnaw so much? No! no! I will nibble your strings as long as my teeth
last, and afterwards do my best for the others. To preserve dependents
by sacrificing oneself is nowhere enjoined by wise moralists; on the
contrary&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Keep wealth for want, but spend-it for thy wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And wife, and wealth, and all to guard thy life,'</span><br />
</div>
<p>&quot;Friend,&quot; replied King Speckle-neck, &quot;that may be the rule of policy,
but I am one that can by no means bear to witness the distress of those
who depend on me, for&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Death, that must come, comes nobly when we give</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our wealth, and life, and all, to make men live,'</span><br />
</div>
<p>And you know the verse,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Friend, art thou faithful? guard mine honor so!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And let the earthy rotting body go,'&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>When King Golden-skin heard this answer his heart was charmed, and his
fur bristled up for pure pleasure. &quot;Nobly spoken, friend,&quot; said he,
&quot;nobly spoken! with such a tenderness for those that look to thee, the
Sovereignty of the Three Worlds might be fitly thine.&quot; So saying he set
himself to cut all their bonds. This done, and the pigeons extricated,
the King of the Mice<a name="FNanchor6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> gave them his formal welcome. &quot;But, your
Majesty,&quot; he said, &quot;this capture in the net was a work of destiny; you
must not blame yourself as you did, and suspect a former fault. Is it
not written&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Floating on his fearless pinions, lost amid the noon-day skies,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even thence the Eagle's vision kens the carcase where it lies;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But the hour that comes to all things comes unto the Lord of Air,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And he rushes, madly blinded, to his ruin in the snare,'&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<p>With this correction Golden-skin proceeded to perform the duties of
hospitality, and afterwards, embracing and dismissing them, the pigeons
left for such destination as they fancied, and the King of the Mice
retired again into his hole.</p>

<p>Now Light o' Leap, the Crow, had been a spectator of the whole
transaction, and wondered at it so much that at last he called out, &quot;Ho!
Golden-skin, thou very laudable Prince, let me too be a friend of thine,
and give me thy friendship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who art thou?&quot; said Golden-skin, who heard him, but would not come out
of his hole.</p>

<p>&quot;I am the Crow Light o' Leap,&quot; replied the other.</p>

<p>&quot;How can I possibly be on good terms with thee?&quot; answered Golden-skin
with a laugh; &quot;have you never read&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'When Food is friends with Feeder, look for Woe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Jackal ate the Deer, but for the Crow,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;No! how was that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will tell thee,&quot; replied Golden-skin:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Jackal_Deer_and_Crow'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Jackal, Deer, and Crow</b></h4>

<p>&quot;Far away in Behar there is a forest called Champak-Grove,<a name="FNanchor7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> and in it
had long lived in much affection a Deer and a Crow. The Deer, roaming
unrestrained, happy and fat of carcase, was one day descried by a
Jackal. 'Ho! ho!' thought the Jackal on observing him, 'if I could but
get this soft meat for a meal! It might be&mdash;if I can only win his
confidence,' Thus reflecting he approached, and saluted him.</p>

<p>'Health be to thee, friend Deer!'</p>

<p>'Who art thou?' said the Deer.</p>

<p>'I'm Small-wit, the Jackal,' replied the other. 'I live in the wood
here, as the dead do, without a friend; but now that I have met with
such a friend as thou, I feel as if I were beginning life again with
plenty of relations. Consider me your faithful servant.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' said the Deer; and then, as the glorious King of Day, whose
diadem is the light, had withdrawn himself, the two went together to the
residence of the Deer. In that same spot, on a branch of Champak, dwelt
the Crow Sharp-sense, an old friend of the Deer. Seeing them approach
together, the Crow said,</p>

<p>'Who is this number two, friend Deer?'</p>

<p>'It is a Jackal,' answered the Deer, 'that desires our acquaintance.'</p>

<p>'You should not become friendly to a stranger without reason,' said
Sharp-sense. 'Don't you know?'</p>

<p>'No! how was that?' said both.</p>

<p>'In this wise,' answered the Crow.</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Vulture_the_Cat_and_the_Birds'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Vulture, the Cat, and the Birds</b></h4>

<p>&quot;On the banks of the Ganges there is a cliff called Vulture-Crag, and
thereupon grew a great fig-tree. It was hollow, and within its shelter
lived an old Vulture, named Grey-pate, whose hard fortune it was to have
lost both eyes and talons. The birds that roosted in the tree made
subscriptions from their own store, out of sheer pity for the poor
fellow, and by that means he managed to live. One day, when the old
birds were gone, Long-ear, the Cat, came there to get a meal of the
nestlings; and they, alarmed at perceiving him, set up a chirruping that
roused Grey-pate.</p>

<p>'Who comes there?' croaked Grey-pate.</p>

<p>&quot;Now Long-ear, on espying the Vulture, thought himself undone; but as
flight was impossible, he resolved to trust his destiny and approach.</p>

<p>'My lord,' said he, 'I have the honor to salute thee.'</p>

<p>'Who is it?' said the Vulture.</p>

<p>'I am a Cat,'</p>

<p>'Be off, Cat, or I shall slay thee,' said the Vulture.</p>

<p>'I am ready to die if I deserve death,' answered the Cat; 'but let what
I have to say be heard,'</p>

<p>'Wherefore, then, comest thou?' said the Vulture.</p>

<p>'I live,' began Long-ear, 'on the Ganges, bathing, and eating no flesh,
practising the moon-penance,<a name="FNanchor8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> like a Bramacharya. The birds that
resort thither constantly praise your worship to me as one wholly given
to the study of morality, and worthy of all trust; and so I came here to
learn law from thee, Sir, who art so deep gone in learning and in years.
Dost thou, then, so read the law of strangers as to be ready to slay a
guest? What say the books about the householder?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Bar thy door not to the stranger, be he friend or be he foe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For the tree will shade the woodman while his axe doth lay it low,'</span><br />

<p>And if means fail, what there is should be given with kind words, as&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Greeting fair, and room to rest in; fire, and water from the well&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Simple gifts&mdash;are given freely in the house where good men dwell,'&mdash;</span><br />

<p>and without respect of person&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Young, or bent with many winters; rich, or poor, whate'er thy guest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Honor him for thine own honor&mdash;better is he than the best,'</span><br />

<p>Else comes the rebuke&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Pity them that ask thy pity: who art thou to stint thy hoard,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When the holy moon shines equal on the leper and the lord!'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And that other, too,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'When thy gate is roughly fastened, and the asker turns away,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thence he bears thy good deeds with him, and his sins on thee doth lay</span><br />
</div>

<p>For verily,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'In the house the husband ruleth, men the Brahmans &quot;master&quot; call;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Agni is the Twice-born Master&mdash;but the guest is lord of all,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;To these weighty words Grey-pate answered,</p>

<p>'Yes! but cats like meat, and there are young birds here, and therefore
I said, go,'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the Cat (and as he spoke he touched the ground, and then his
two ears, and called on Krishna to witness to his words), 'I that have
overcome passion, and practised the moon-penance, know the Scriptures;
and howsoever they contend, in this primal duty of abstaining from
injury they are unanimous. Which of them sayeth not&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'He who does and thinks no wrong&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He who suffers, being strong&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He whose harmlessness men know&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto Swerga such doth go.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;And so, winning the old Vulture's confidence, Long-ear, the Cat,
entered the hollow tree and lived there. And day after day he stole away
some of the nestlings, and brought them down to the hollow to devour.
Meantime the parent birds, whose little ones were being eaten, made an
inquiry after them in all quarters; and the Cat, discovering this fact,
slipped out from the hollow, and made his escape. Afterwards, when the
birds came to look closely, they found the bones of their young ones in
the hollow of the tree where Grey-pate lived; and the birds at once
concluded that their nestlings had been killed and eaten by the old
Vulture, whom they accordingly executed. That is my story, and why I
warned you against unknown acquaintances.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir,&quot; said the Jackal, with some warmth, &quot;on the first day of your
encountering the Deer you also were of unknown family and character: how
is it, then, that your friendship with him grows daily greater? True, I
am only Small-wit, the Jackal, but what says the saw?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;In the land where no wise men are, men of little wit are lords;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the castor-oil's a tree, where no tree else its shade affords.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>The Deer is my friend; condescend, sir, to be my friend also.&quot;</p>

<p>'Oh!' broke in the Deer, 'why so much talking? We'll all live together,
and be friendly and happy&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Foe is friend, and friend is foe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As our actions make them so,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;Very good,&quot; said Sharp-sense; &quot;as you will;&quot; and in the morning each
started early for his own feeding-ground (returning at night). One day
the Jackal drew the Deer aside, and whispered, 'Deer, in one corner of
this wood there is a field full of sweet young wheat; come and let me
show you.' The Deer accompanied him, and found the field, and afterwards
went every day there to eat the green corn, till at last the owner of
the ground spied him and set a snare. The Deer came again very shortly,
and was caught in it, and (after vainly struggling) exclaimed, 'I am
fast in the net, and it will be a net of death to me if no friend comes
to rescue me!' Presently Small-wit, the Jackal, who had been lurking
near, made his appearance, and standing still, he said to himself, with
a chuckle, 'O ho! my scheme bears fruit! When he is cut up, his bones,
and gristle, and blood, will fall to my share and make me some beautiful
dinners,' The Deer, here catching sight of him, exclaimed with rapture,
'Ah, friend, this is excellent! Do but gnaw these strings, and I shall
be at liberty. How charming to realize the saying!&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'That friend only is the true friend who is near when trouble comes;</span><br />

</div>

<p>&quot;Small-wit answered nothing, but betook himself to examining the snare
very closely.</p>

<p>'This will certainly hold,' muttered he; then, turning to the Deer, he
said, 'Good friend, these strings, you see, are made of sinew, and
to-day is a fast-day, so that I cannot possibly bite them. To-morrow
morning, if you still desire it, I shall be happy to serve you,'</p>

<p>When he was gone, the Crow, who had missed the Deer upon returning that
evening, and had sought for him everywhere, discovered him; and seeing
his sad plight, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'How came this about, my friend?'</p>

<p>'This came,' replied the Deer, 'through disregarding a friend's advice,'</p>

<p>'Where is that rascal Small-wit?' asked the Crow.</p>

<p>'He is waiting somewhere by,' said the Deer, 'to taste my flesh,'</p>

<p>'Well,' sighed the Crow, 'I warned you; but it is as in the true verse&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Stars gleam, lamps flicker, friends foretell of fate;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fated sees, knows, hears them&mdash;all too late.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And then, with a deeper sigh, he exclaimed,'Ah, traitor Jackal, what an
ill deed hast thou done! Smooth-tongued knave&mdash;alas!&mdash;and in the face of
the monition too&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Absent, flatterers' tongues are daggers&mdash;present, softer than the silk;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shun them! 'tis a jar of poison hidden under harmless milk;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For, enkindled, charcoal burneth&mdash;cold, it doth defile the touch.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>When the day broke, the Crow (who was still there) saw the master of the
field approaching with his club in his hand.</p>

<p>'Now, friend Deer,' said Sharp-sense on perceiving him, 'do thou cause
thyself to seem like one dead: puff thy belly up with wind, stiffen thy
legs out, and lie very still. I will make a show of pecking thine eyes
out with my beak; and whensoever I utter a croak, then spring to thy
feet and betake thee to flight.'</p>

<p>The Deer thereon placed himself exactly as the Crow suggested, and was
very soon espied by the husbandman, whose eyes opened with joy at the
sight.</p>

<p>'Aha!' said he, 'the fellow has died of himself,' and so speaking, he
released the Deer from the snare, and proceeded to gather and lay aside
his nets. At that instant Sharp-sense uttered a loud croak, and the Deer
sprang up and made off. And the club which the husbandman flung after
him in a rage struck Small-wit, the Jackal (who was close by), and
killed him. Is it not said, indeed?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'In years, or moons, or half-moons three,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or in three days&mdash;suddenly,</span><br />

</div>

<p>&quot;Thou seest, then,&quot; said Golden-skin, &quot;there can be no friendship
between food and feeder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should hardly,&quot; replied the Crow, &quot;get a large breakfast out of your
worship; but as to that indeed you have nothing to fear from me. I am
not often angry, and if I were, you know&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Anger comes to noble natures, but leaves there no strife or storm:</span><br />

<p>&quot;Maybe,&quot; answered Light o' Leap; &quot;but I am bent on winning thy
friendship, and I will die at thy door of fasting if thou grantest it
not. Let us be friends! for</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And what craftsman's ready cunning can unite the shards again?'</span><br />

<p>And then, too,</p>

</div>

<p>&quot;Good sir,&quot; said the King of the Mice, &quot;your conversation is as pleasing
as pearl necklets or oil of sandal-wood in hot weather. Be it as you
will&quot;&mdash;and thereon King Golden-skin made a treaty with the Crow, and
after gratifying him with the best of his store re&euml;ntered his hole. The
Crow returned to his accustomed perch:&mdash;and thenceforward the time
passed in mutual presents of food, in polite inquiries, and the most
unrestrained talk. One day Light o' Leap thus accosted Golden-skin:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a poor place, your Majesty, for a Crow to get a living in. I
should like to leave it and go elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Whither wouldst thou go?&quot; replied the King; they say,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'One foot goes, and one foot stands,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When the wise man leaves his lands.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;And they say, too,&quot; answered the Crow,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Over-love of home were weakness; wheresoever the hero come,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stalwart arm and steadfast spirit find or win for him a home.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Little recks the awless lion where his hunting jungles lie&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When he enters it be certain that a royal prey shall die,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;I know an excellent jungle now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which is that?&quot; asked the Mouse-king.</p>

<p>&quot;In the Nerbudda woods, by Camphor-water,&quot; replied the Crow. &quot;There is
an old and valued friend of mine lives there&mdash;Slow-toes his name is, a
very virtuous Tortoise; he will regale me with fish and good things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why should I stay behind,&quot; said Golden-skin, &quot;if thou goest? Take me
also.&quot;</p>

<p>Accordingly, the two set forth together, enjoying charming converse upon
the road. Slow-toes perceived Light o' Leap a long way off, and hastened
to do him the guest-rites, extending them to the Mouse upon Light o'
Leap's introduction.</p>

<p>&quot;Good Slow-toes,&quot; said he, &quot;this is Golden-skin, King of the Mice&mdash;pay
all honor to him&mdash;he is burdened with virtues&mdash;a very jewel-mine of
kindnesses. I don't know if the Prince of all the Serpents, with his two
thousand tongues, could rightly repeat them.&quot; So speaking, he told the
story of Speckle-neck. Thereupon Slow-toes made a profound obeisance to
Golden-skin, and said, &quot;How came your Majesty, may I ask, to retire to
an unfrequented forest?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will tell you,&quot; said the King. &quot;You must know that in the town of
Champaka there is a college for the devotees. Unto this resorted daily a
beggar-priest, named Chudakarna, whose custom was to place his
begging-dish upon the shelf, with such alms in it as he had not eaten,
and go to sleep by it; and I, so soon as he slept, used to jump up, and
devour the meal. One day a great friend of his, named Vinakarna, also a
mendicant, came to visit him; and observed that while conversing, he
kept striking the ground with a split cane, to frighten me. 'Why don't
you listen?' said Vinakarna. 'I am listening!' replied the other; 'but
this plaguy mouse is always eating the meal out of my begging-dish,'
Vinakarna looked at the shelf and remarked, 'However can a mouse jump as
high as this? There must be a reason, though there seems none. I guess
the cause&mdash;the fellow is well off and fat,' With these words Vinakarna
snatched up a shovel, discovered my retreat, and took away all my hoard
of provisions. After that I lost strength daily, had scarcely energy
enough to get my dinner, and, in fact, crept about so wretchedly, that
when Chudakarna saw me he fell to quoting&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Very feeble folk are poor folk; money lost takes wit away:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All their doings fail like runnels, wasting through the summer day.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; I thought, &quot;he is right, and so are the sayings&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Wealth is friends, home, father, brother&mdash;title to respect and fame;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Yea, and wealth is held for wisdom&mdash;that it should be so is shame,'</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>Earth unto the idle-minded; and the three worlds to the poor.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'I can stay here no longer; and to tell my distress to another is out of
the question&mdash;altogether out of the question!&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Say the sages, nine things name not: Age, domestic joys and woes,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fire consents to be extinguished, but submits not to be cold.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Verily he was wise, methought also, who wrote&mdash;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So Poverty can surely</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>A hundred virtues slay.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'And as to sustaining myself on another man's bread, that,' I mused,
'would be but a second door of death. Say not the books the same?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Half-known knowledge, present pleasure purchased with a future woe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And to taste the salt of service&mdash;greater griefs no man can know.'</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'All existence is not equal, and all living is not life;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sick men live; and he who, banished, pines for children, home, and wife;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the craven-hearted eater of another's leavings lives,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But they bear an anguished body, and they draw a deadly breath,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And life cometh to them only on the happy day of death.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Yet, after all these reflections, I was covetous enough to make one
more attempt on Chudakarna's meal, and got a blow from the split cane
for my pains. 'Just so,' I said to myself, 'the soul and organs of the
discontented want keeping in subjection. I must be done with
discontent:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Golden gift, serene Contentment! have thou that, and all is had; Thrust
thy slipper on, and think thee that the earth is leather-clad.'</p>

<p>'All is known, digested, tested; nothing new is left to learn When the
soul, serene, reliant, Hope's delusive dreams can spurn.'</p>

<p>'And the sorry task of seeking favor is numbered in the miseries of
life&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hast thou never watched, a-waiting till the great man's door unbarred?
Didst thou never linger parting, saying many a last sad word? Spak'st
thou never word of folly, one light thing thou wouldst recall? Rare and
noble hath thy life been! fair thy fortune did befall!'</p>

<p>'No!' exclaimed I, 'I will do none of these; but, by retiring into the
quiet and untrodden forest, I will show my discernment of real good and
ill. The holy Books counsel it&mdash;</p>

<p>'True Religion!&mdash;'tis not blindly prating what the priest may prate, But
to love, as God hath loved them, all things, be they small or great; And
true bliss is when a sane mind doth a healthy body fill; And true
knowledge is the knowing what is good and what is ill.'</p>

<p>&quot;So came I to the forest, where, by good fortune and this good friend, I
met much kindness; and by the same good fortune have encountered you,
Sir, whose friendliness is as Heaven to me. Ah! Sir Tortoise,</p>

</div>

<p>&quot;Did he, indeed,&quot; said Golden-skin; &quot;and how was that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will tell you,&quot; answered Slow-toes:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Dead_Game_and_the_Jackal'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Dead Game and the Jackal</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In a town called 'Well-to-Dwell' there lived a mighty hunter, whose
name was 'Grim-face,' Feeling a desire one day for a little venison, he
took his bow, and went into the woods; where he soon killed a deer. As
he was carrying the deer home, he came upon a wild boar of prodigious
proportions. Laying the deer upon the earth, he fixed and discharged an
arrow and struck the boar, which instantly rushed upon him with a roar
louder than the last thunder, and ripped the hunter up. He fell like a
tree cut by the axe, and lay dead along with the boar, and a snake also,
which had been crushed by the feet of the combatants. Not long
afterwards, there came that way, in his prowl for food, a Jackal, named
'Howl o' Nights,' and cast eyes on the hunter, the deer, the boar, and
the snake lying dead together. 'Aha!' said he,' what luck! Here's a
grand dinner got ready for me! Good fortune can come, I see, as well as
ill fortune. Let me think:&mdash;the man will be fine pickings for a month;
the deer with the boar will last two more; the snake will do for
to-morrow; and, as I am very particularly hungry, I will treat myself
now to this bit of meat on the bow-horn,' So saying, he began to gnaw it
asunder, and the bow-string slipping, the bow sprang back, and resolved
Howl o' Nights into the five elements by death. That is my story,&quot;
continued Slow-toes, &quot;and its application is for the wise:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Sentences of studied wisdom, nought avail they unapplied;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though the blind man hold a lantern, yet his footsteps stray aside.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>The secret of success, indeed, is a free, contented, and yet
enterprising mind. How say the books thereon?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Wouldst thou know whose happy dwelling Fortune entereth unknown?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His, who careless of her favor, standeth fearless in his own;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His, who for the vague to-morrow barters not the sure to-day&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Master of himself, and sternly steadfast to the rightful way:</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto such comes Lakshmi<a name="FNanchor9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> smiling&mdash;comes, and will not lightly part.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;What indeed,&quot; continued Slow-toes, &quot;is wealth, that we should prize it,
or grieve to lose it?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Be not haughty, being wealthy; droop not, having lost thine all;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fate doth play with mortal fortunes as a girl doth toss her ball.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>It is unstable by nature. We are told&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Worldly friendships, fair but fleeting, shadows of the clouds at noon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Women, youth, new corn, and riches&mdash;these be pleasures passing soon.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And it is idle to be anxious; the Master of Life knows how to sustain
it. Is it not written?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'For thy bread be not o'er thoughtful&mdash;God for all hath taken thought:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When the babe is born, the sweet milk to the mother's breast is brought.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He who gave the swan her silver, and the hawk her plumes of pride,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And his purples to the peacock&mdash;He will verily provide.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;Yes, verily,&quot; said Slow-toes, &quot;wealth is bad to handle, and better left
alone; there is no truer saying than this&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Though for good ends, waste not on wealth a minute;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mud may be wiped, but wise men plunge not in it.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Hearing the wisdom of these monitions, Light o' Leap broke out, 'Good
Slow-toes! thou art a wise protector of those that come to thee; thy
learning comforts my enlightened friend, as elephants drag elephants
from the mire,' And thus, on the best of terms, wandering where they
pleased for food, the three lived there together.</p>

<p>One day it chanced that a Deer named Dapple-back, who had seen some
cause of alarm in the forest, came suddenly upon the three in his
flight. Thinking the danger imminent, Slow-toes dropped into the water,
King Golden-skin slipped into his hole, and Light o' Leap flew up into
the top of a high tree. Thence he looked all round to a great distance,
but could discover nothing. So they all came back again, and sat down
together. Slow-toes welcomed the Deer.</p>

<p>'Good Deer,' said he, 'may grass and water never fail thee at thy need.
Gratify us by residing here, and consider this forest thine own.'</p>

<p>'Indeed,' answered Dapple-back, 'I came hither for your protection,
flying from a hunter; and to live with you in friendship is my greatest
desire.'</p>

<p>'Then the thing is settled,' observed Golden-skin.</p>

<p>'Yes! yes!' said Light o' Leap, 'make yourself altogether at home!'</p>

<p>So the Deer, charmed at his reception, ate grass and drank water, and
laid himself down in the shade of a Banyan-tree to talk. Who does not
know?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Brunettes, and the Banyan's shadow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Well-springs, and a brick-built wall.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are all alike cool in the summer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And warm in the winter&mdash;all.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'What made thee alarmed, friend Deer?' began Slow-toes. 'Do hunters ever
come to this unfrequented forest?'</p>

<p>'I have heard,' replied Dapple-back, 'that the Prince of the Kalinga
country, Rukmangada, is coming here. He is even now encamped on the
Cheenab River, on his march to subjugate the borders; and the hunters
have been heard to say that he will halt to-morrow by this very lake of
&quot;Camphor-water.&quot; Don't you think, as it is dangerous to stay, that we
ought to resolve on something?'</p>

<p>'I shall certainly go to another pool,' exclaimed Slow-toes.</p>

<p>'It would be better,' answered the Crow and Deer together.</p>

<p>'Yes!' remarked the King of the Mice, after a minute's thought; 'but how
is Slow-toes to get across the country in time? Animals like our
amphibious host are best in the water; on land he might suffer from his
own design, like the merchant's son&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'The merchant's son laid plans for gains,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And saw his wife kissed for his pains.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'How came that about?' asked all. &quot;I'll tell you,&quot; answered Golden-skin.</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Prince_and_the_Wife_of_the_Merchants_Son'></a><h4><b>The Prince and the Wife of the Merchant's Son</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In the country of Kanouj there was a King named Virasena, and he made
his son viceroy of a city called Virapoora. The Prince was rich,
handsome, and in the bloom of youth. Passing through the streets of his
city one day, he observed a very lovely woman, whose name was
L&aacute;vanyavati&mdash;i.e., the Beautiful&mdash;the wife of a merchant's son. On
reaching his palace, full of her charms and of passionate admiration for
them, he despatched a message to her, and a letter, by a female
attendant:&mdash;who wonders at it?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Ah! the gleaming, glancing arrows of a lovely woman's eye!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Feathered with her jetty lashes, perilous they pass us by:&mdash;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All too penetrant and deadly for an undefended heart.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Now L&aacute;vanyavati, from the moment she saw the Prince, was hit with the
same weapon of love that wounded him; but upon hearing the message of
the attendant, she refused with dignity to receive his letter.</p>

<p>'Is such my answer?' asked the attendant.</p>

<p>'It is,' said L&aacute;vanyavati.</p>

<p>Upon the messenger reporting her reply to the Prince, he was in despair.</p>

<p>'The God of the five shafts has hit me,' he exclaimed, 'and only her
presence will cure my wound.'</p>

<p>'We must make her husband bring her, then,' said the messenger.</p>

<p>'That can never be,' replied the Prince.</p>

<p>'It can,' replied the messenger&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Fraud may achieve what force would never try:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Jackal killed the Elephant thereby.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'How was that?' asked the Prince. The Slave related:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Old_Jackal_and_the_Elephant'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Old Jackal and the Elephant</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In the forest of Brahma<a name="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> lived an Elephant, whose name was
'White-front.' The Jackals knew him, and said among themselves, 'If this
great brute would but die, there would be four months' food for us, and
plenty, out of his carcase.' With that an old Jackal stood up, and
pledged himself to compass the death of the Elephant by his own wit.
Accordingly, he sought for 'White-front,' and, going up to him, he made
the reverential prostration of the eight members, gravely saluting him.</p>

<p>'Divine creature,' said he, 'vouchsafe me the regard of one look.'</p>

<p>'Who art thou?' grunted the Elephant,'and whence comest thou?'</p>

<p>'I am only a Jackal,' said the other; 'but the beasts of the forest are
convinced that it is not expedient to live without a king, and they have
met in full council, and despatched me to acquaint your Royal Highness
that on you, endowed with so many lordly qualities, their choice has
fallen for a sovereign over the forest here; for&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Who is just, and strong, and wise?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who is true to social ties?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He is formed for Emperies.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Let your Majesty, therefore, repair thither at once, that the moment of
fortunate conjunction may not escape us.' So saying he led the way,
followed at a great pace by White-front, who was eager to commence his
reign.</p>

<p>&quot;Presently the Jackal brought him upon a deep slough, into which he
plunged heavily before he could stop himself.</p>

<p>'Good master Jackal,' cried the Elephant,'what's to do now? I am up to
my belly in this quagmire.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps your Majesty,' said the Jackal, with an impudent laugh, 'will
condescend to take hold of the tip of my brush with your trunk, and so
get out.'</p>

<p>'Then White-front, the Elephant, knew that he had been deceived; and
thus he sank in the slime, and was devoured by the Jackals. Hence,'
continued the attendant, 'is why I suggested stratagem to your
Highness,'</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards, by the Slave's advice, the Prince sent for the
merchant's son (whose name was Charudatta), and appointed him to be near
his person; and one day, with the same design, when he was just come
from the bath, and had on his jewels, he summoned Charudatta, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I have a vow to keep to Gauri&mdash;bring hither to me every evening for a
month some lady of good family, that I may do honor to her, according to
my vow; and begin to-day.&quot;</p>

<p>Charudatta in due course brought a lady of quality, and, having
introduced her, retired to watch the interview. The Prince, without even
approaching his fair visitor, made her the most respectful obeisances,
and dismissed her with gifts of ornaments, sandal-wood, and perfumes,
under the protection of a guard. This made Charudatta confident, and
longing to get some of these princely presents he brought his own wife
next evening. When the Prince recognized the charming L&aacute;vanyavati&mdash;the
joy of his soul&mdash;he sprang to meet her, and kissed and caressed her
without the least restraint. At sight of this the miserable Charudatta
stood transfixed with despair&mdash;the very picture of wretchedness'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'And you too, Slow-toes&mdash;but where is he gone?' abruptly asked King
Golden-skin.</p>

<p>Now Slow-toes had not chosen to wait the end of the story, but was gone
before, and Golden-skin and the others followed him up in some anxiety.
The Tortoise had been painfully travelling along, until a hunter, who
was beating the wood for game, had overtaken him. The fellow, who was
very hungry, picked him up, fastened him on his bow-stick, and set off
for home; while the Deer, the Crow, and the Mouse, who had witnessed
the capture, followed them in terrible concern. 'Alas!' cried the
Mouse-king, 'he is gone!&mdash;and such a friend!</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Friend! gracious word!&mdash;the heart to tell is ill able</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whence came to men this jewel of a syllable.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Let us,' continued he to his companions, 'let us make one attempt, at
least, to rescue Slow-toes before the hunter is out of the wood!'</p>

<p>'Only tell us how to do it,' replied they.</p>

<p>'Do thus,' said Golden-skin: 'let Dapple-back hasten on to the water,
and lie down there and make himself appear dead; and do you, Light o'
Leap, hover over him and peck about his body. The hunter is sure to put
the Tortoise down to get the venison, and I will gnaw his bonds.'</p>

<p>'The Deer and the Crow started at once; and the hunter, who was sitting
down to rest under a tree and drinking water, soon caught sight of the
Deer, apparently dead. Drawing his wood-knife, and putting the Tortoise
down by the water, he hastened to secure the Deer, and Golden-skin, in
the meantime, gnawed asunder the string that held Slow-toes, who
instantly dropped into the pool. The Deer, of course, when the hunter
got near, sprang up and made off, and when he returned to the tree the
Tortoise was gone also. &quot;I deserve this,&quot; thought he&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Whoso for greater quits his gain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall have his labor for his pain;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The things unwon unwon remain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And what was won is lost again.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And so lamenting, he went to his village. Slow-toes and his friends,
quit of all fears, repaired together to their new habitations, and there
lived happily.</p>

<p>Then spake the King Sudarsana's sons, &quot;We have heard every word, and are
delighted; it fell out just as we wished.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I rejoice thereat, my Princes,&quot; said Vishnu-Sarman; &quot;may it also fall
out according to this my wish&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;In the Deccan there is a city called Golden-town, and a wealthy
merchant lived there named Well-to-do. He had abundant means, but as
many of his relations were even yet richer, his mind was bent: upon
outdoing them by gaining more. Enough is never what we have&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Looking down on lives below them, men of little store are great;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Looking up to higher fortunes, hard to each man seems his fate.'</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'As a bride, unwisely wedded, shuns the cold caress of eld,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So, from coward souls and slothful, Lakshmi's favors turn repelled.'</span><br />

<p>And wealth that increases not, diminishes&mdash;a little gain is so far

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wisdom comes in little lessons&mdash;little gains make largest store.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Moved by these reflections Well-to-do loaded a cart with wares of all
kinds, yoked two bulls to it, named Lusty-life and Roarer, and started
for Kashmir to trade. He had not gone far upon his journey when in
passing through a great forest called Bramble-wood, Lusty-life slipped
down and broke his foreleg. At sight of this disaster Well-to-do fell
a-thinking, and repeated&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Men their cunning schemes may spin&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>God knows who shall lose or win.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Comforting himself with such philosophy, Well-to-do left Lusty-life
there, and went on his way. The Bull watched him depart, and stood
mournfully on three legs, alone in the forest. 'Well, well,' he thought,
'it is all destiny whether I live or die:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Shoot a hundred shafts, the quarry lives and flies&mdash;not due to death;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When his hour is come, a grass-blade hath a point to stop his breath.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>As the days passed by, and Lusty-life picked about in the tender forest
grass, he grew wonderfully well, and fat of carcase, and happy, and
bellowed about the wood as though it were his own. Now, the reigning
monarch of the forest was King Tawny-hide the Lion, who ruled over the
whole country absolutely, by right of having deposed everybody else. Is
not might right?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Robes were none, nor oil of unction, when the King of Beasts was crowned:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Twas his own fierce roar proclaimed him, rolling all his kingdom round.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>One morning, his Majesty, being exceedingly thirsty, had repaired to the
bank of the Jumna to drink water, and just as he was about to lap it,
the bellow of Lusty-life, awful as the thunder of the last day, reached
the imperial ears. Upon catching the sound the King retreated in
trepidation to his own lair, without drinking a drop, and stood there in
silence and alarm revolving what it could mean. In this position he was
observed by the sons of his minister, two jackals named Karataka and
Damanaka, who began to remark upon it.</p>

<p>'Friend Karataka,' said the last,'what makes our royal master slink away
from the river when he was dying to drink?'</p>

<p>'Why should we care?' replied Karataka. 'It's bad enough to serve him,
and be neglected for our pains&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>'I care not,' replied Karataka; 'we have nothing to do with it, and
matters that don't concern us are best left alone. You know the story of
the Monkey, don't you?'&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'The Monkey drew the sawyer's wedge, and died:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let meddlers mark it, and be edified.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'No!' said Damanaka. 'How was it?'</p>

<p>'In this way,' answered Karataka:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Monkey_and_the_Wedge'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Monkey and the Wedge</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In South Behar, close by the retreat of Dhurmma, there was an open plot
of ground, upon which a temple was in course of erection, under the
management of a man of the K&aacute;yeth caste, named Subhadatta. A carpenter
upon the works had partly sawed through a long beam of wood, and wedged
it open, and was gone away, leaving the wedge fixed. Shortly afterwards
a large herd of monkeys came frolicking that way, and one of their
number, directed doubtless by the Angel of death, got astride the beam,
and grasped the wedge, with his tail and lower parts dangling down
between the pieces of the wood. Not content with this, in the mischief
natural to monkeys, he began to tug at the wedge; till at last it
yielded to a great effort and came out; when the wood closed upon him,
and jammed him all fast. So perished the monkey, miserably crushed; and
I say again&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Let meddlers mark it, and be edified.'</span><br /></div>

<p>'But surely,' argued Damanaka, 'servants are bound to watch the
movements of their masters!'</p>

<p>'Let the prime minister do it, then,' answered Karataka; 'it is his
business to overlook things, and subordinates shouldn't interfere in the
department of their chief. You might get ass's thanks for it&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'The Ass that hee-hawed, when the dog should do it,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For his lord's welfare, like an ass did rue it.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Damanaka asked how that happened, and Karataka related:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Washermans_Jackass'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Washerman's Jackass</b></h4>

<p>&quot;There was a certain Washerman at Benares, whose name was Carp&uacute;rapataka,
and he had an Ass and a Dog in his courtyard; the first tethered, and
the last roaming loose. Once on a time, when he had been spending his
morning in the society of his wife, whom he had just married, and had
fallen to sleep in her arms, a robber entered the house, and began to
carry off his goods. The Ass observed the occupation of the thief, and
was much concerned.</p>

<p>'Good Dog,' said he, 'this is thy matter: why dost thou not bark aloud,
and rouse the master?'</p>

<p>'Gossip Ass,' replied the Dog, 'leave me alone to guard the premises. I
can do it, if I choose; but the truth is, this master of ours thinks
himself so safe lately that he clean forgets me, and I don't find my
allowance of food nearly regular enough. Masters will do so; and a
little fright will put him in mind of his defenders again.'</p>

<p>'Thou scurvy cur!' exclaimed the Ass&mdash;</p>

<p>'At the work-time, asking wages&mdash;is it like a faithful herd?'</p>

<p>'Thou extreme Ass!' replied the Dog.</p>

<p>'When the work's done, grudging wages&mdash;is that acting like a lord?'</p>

<p>'Mean-spirited beast,' retorted the Ass, 'who neglectest thy master's
business! Well, then, I at least will endeavor to arouse him; it is no
less than religion,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Serve the Sun with sweat of body; starve thy maw to feed the flame;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stead thy lord with all thy service; to thy death go, quit of blame.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>So saying, he put forth his very best braying. The Washerman sprang up
at the noise, and missing the thief, turned in a rage upon the Ass for
disturbing him, and beat it with a cudgel to such an extent that the
blows resolved the poor animal into the five elements of death. 'So
that,' continued Karataka, 'is why I say, Let the prime minister look to
him. The hunting for prey is our duty&mdash;let us stick to it, then. And
this,' he said, with a meditative look, 'need not trouble us to-day; for
we have a capital dish of the royal leavings.'</p>

<p>'What!' said Damanaka, rough with rage, 'dost thou serve the King for
the sake of thy belly? Why take any such trouble to preserve an
existence like thine?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Many prayers for him are uttered whereon many a life relies;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis but one poor fool the fewer when the gulping Raven dies.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>For assisting friends, and defeating enemies also, the service of kings
is desirable. To enter upon it for a mere living makes the thing low
indeed. There must be dogs and elephants; but servants need not be like
hungry curs, while their masters are noble. What say the books?</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Give thy Dog the merest mouthful, and he crouches at thy feet,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gravely&mdash;after much entreaty&mdash;condescends that mighty king.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Well, well!' said Karataka; 'the books are nothing to us, who are not
councillors.'</p>

<p>'But we may come to be,' replied Damanaka; 'men rise, not by chance or
nature, but by exertions&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'By their own deeds men go downward, by them men mount upward all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like the diggers of a well, and like the builders of a wall.'</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Rushes down the hill the crag, which upward 'twas so hard to roll:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So to virtue slowly rises&mdash;so to vice quick sinks the soul.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Very good,' observed Karataka; 'but what is all this talk about?'</p>

<p>'Why! don't you see our Royal Master there, and how he came home without
drinking? I know he has been horribly frightened,' said Damanaka.</p>

<p>'How do you know it?' asked the other.</p>

<p>'By my perception&mdash;at a glance!' replied Damanaka; 'and I mean to make
out of this occasion that which shall put his Majesty at my disposal,'</p>

<p>'Now,' exclaimed Karataka, 'it is thou who art ignorant about service&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Who speaks unasked, or comes unbid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or counts on favor&mdash;will be chid.'</span><br />

the secret of it&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Wise, modest, constant, ever close at hand,</span><br />

</div>

<p>'In any case, the King often rates thee,' remarked Karataka, 'for coming
to the presence unsummoned.'</p>

<p>'A dependent,' replied Damanaka, 'should nevertheless present himself;
he must make himself known to the great man, at any risk&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Pitiful, that fearing failure, therefore no beginning makes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who forswears his daily dinner for the chance of stomach-aches?'</span><br />
</div>

<p>and besides, to be near is at last to be needful;&mdash;is it not said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Nearest to the King is dearest, be thy merit low or high;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Women, creeping plants, and princes, twine round that which groweth nigh.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Well,' inquired Karataka, 'what wilt thou say, being come to him?'</p>

<p>'First,' replied Damanaka, 'I will discover if his Majesty is well
affected to me.'</p>

<p>'How do you compass that?' asked the other.</p>

<p>'Oh, easily! by a look, a word,' answered Damanaka; 'and that
ascertained, I will proceed to speak what will put him at my disposal.'</p>

<p>'I can't see how you can venture to speak,' objected the other,
'without an opportunity&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'If Vrihaspati, the Grave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Spoke a sentence out of season,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Strong rebuke for such unreason.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Pray don't imagine I shall speak unseasonably,' interrupted Damanaka;
'if that is all you fear, I will start at once.'</p>

<p>'Go, then,' said Karataka; 'and may you be as lucky as you hope.'</p>

<p>&quot;Thereupon Damanaka set out for the lair of King Tawny-hide; putting on,
as he approached it, the look of one greatly disconcerted. The Rajah
observed him coming, and gave permission that he should draw near; of
which Damanaka availing himself, made reverential prostration of the
eight members and sat down upon his haunches.</p>

<p>'You have come at last, then, Sir Jackal!' growled his Majesty.</p>

<p>'Great Monarch!' humbly replied Damanaka, 'my service is not worthy of
laying at your imperial feet, but a servant should attend when he can
perform a service, and therefore I am come&mdash;</p>

<p>'Your Majesty suspects my intellect, I fear,' continued the
Jackal,'after so long an absence from your Majesty's feet; but, if I may
say so, it is still sound.'</p>

<p>'Good Damanaka,' said King Tawny-hide, somewhat appeased, 'how is it
that thou, so wise a son of our first minister, hast been absent all
this while from our Court? But now speak thy mind fearlessly: what
wouldst thou?'</p>

<p>'Will your Majesty deign to answer one question?' said Damanaka.
'Wherefore came He back from the river without drinking?'</p>

<p>'Hush!' whispered the King, 'thou hast hit right upon my trouble. I knew
no one unto whom I might confide it; but thou seemest a faithful fellow,
and I will tell thee. Listen, then,' continued his Majesty in an
agitated whisper, 'there is some awful beast that was never seen before
in this wood here; and we shall have to leave it, look you. Did you hear
by chance the inconceivable great roar he gave? What a strong beast it
must be to have such a voice!'</p>

<p>'May it please your Majesty, I did hear the noise,' said the Jackal,
'and there is doubtless cause for terrible apprehension therein; but
take comfort, my Liege, he is no minister who bids thee prepare for
either war or resignation. All will go well, and your Majesty will learn
by this difficulty which be your best servants,'</p>

<p>'Good Jackal,' said Tawny-hide, 'I am horribly frightened about it.'</p>

<p>'I can see that,' thought Damanaka; but he only said, 'Fear nothing, my
liege, while thy servant survives,'</p>

<p>'What shall I do?' asked the King.</p>

<p>'It is well to encourage those who can avert disaster. If your Majesty
condescended now to bestow some favor on Karataka and the other&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It shall be done,' said the Rajah; and, summoning the other Jackals, he
gave them and Damanaka a magnificent gift of flesh, and they left the
presence, undertaking to meet the threatened danger.</p>

<p>'But, brother,' began Karataka,'haven't we eaten the King's dinner
without knowing what the danger is which we are to meet, and whether we
can obviate it?'</p>

<p>'Hold thy peace,' said Damanaka, laughing; 'I know very well what the
danger is! It was a bull, aha! that bellowed&mdash;a bull, my brother&mdash;whose
beef you and I could pick, much more the King our master.'</p>

<p>'And why not tell him so?' asked Karataka.</p>

<p>'What! and quiet his Majesty's fears! And where would our splendid
dinner have been then? No, no, my friend&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Set not your lord at ease; for, doing that,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Might starve you as it starved &quot;Curd-ear&quot; the Cat.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Who was Curd-ear, the Cat?' inquired Karataka. Damanaka related:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Cat_Who_Served_the_Lion'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Cat Who Served the Lion</b></h4>

<p>&quot;Far away in the North, on a mountain named 'Thousand-Crags,' there
lived a lion called 'Mighty-heart'; and he was much annoyed by a certain
mouse, who made a custom of nibbling his mane while he lay asleep in his
den. The Lion would wake in a great rage at finding the ends of his
magnificent mane made ragged, but the little mouse ran into his hole,
and he could never catch it. After much consideration he went down to a
village, and got a Cat named Curd-ear to come to his cave with much
persuasion. He kept the Cat royally on all kinds of dainties, and slept
comfortably without having his mane nibbled, as the mouse would now
never venture out. Whenever the Lion heard the mouse scratching about,
that was always a signal for regaling the Cat in a most distinguished
style. But one day, the wretched mouse being nearly starved, he took
courage to creep timidly from his hole, and was directly pounced upon by
Curd-ear and killed. After that the Lion heard no more of the mouse, and
quite left off his regular entertainments of the Cat. No!&quot; concluded
Damanaka, &quot;we will keep our mouse alive for his Majesty.&quot;</p>

<p>So conversing, the Jackals went away to find Lusty-life the Bull, and
upon discovering him, Karataka squatted down with great dignity at the
foot of a tree, while Damanaka approached to accost him.</p>

<p>'Bull,' said Damanaka, 'I am the warder of this forest under the King
Tawny-hide, and Karataka the Jackal there is his General. The General
bids thee come before him, or else instantly depart from the wood. It
were better for thee to obey, for his anger is terrible,'</p>

<p>'Thereupon Lusty-life, knowing nothing of the country customs, advanced
at once to Karataka, made the respectful prostration of the eight
members, and said timidly, 'My Lord General! what dost thou bid me do?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Strength serves Reason. Saith the Mahout, when he beats the brazen drum,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Ho! ye elephants, to this work must your mightinesses come.&quot;'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Bull,' answered Karataka, 'thou canst remain in the wood no longer
unless thou goest directly to lay thyself at our Royal master's imperial
feet.'</p>

<p>'My Lord,' replied the Bull, 'give me a guarantee of safety, and I will
go.'</p>

<p>'Bull,' said Karataka, 'thou art foolish; fear nothing&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;When the King of Chedi cursed him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Krishna scorned to make reply;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lions roar the thunder quiet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Jackals'-yells they let go by.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>Our Lord the King will not vouchsafe his anger to thee; knowest thou
not&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Mighty natures war with mighty: when the raging tempests blow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O'er the green rice harmless pass they, but they lay the palm-trees low,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'So the Jackals, keeping Lusty-life in the rear, went towards the palace
of King Tawny-hide; where the Rajah received them with much
graciousness, and bade them sit down.</p>

<p>'Have you seen him?' asked the King.</p>

<p>'We have seen him, your Majesty,' answered Damanaka; 'it is quite as
your Majesty expected&mdash;the creature has enormous strength, and wishes
to see your Majesty. Will you be seated, Sire, and prepare yourself&mdash;it
will never do to appear alarmed at a noise.'</p>

<p>'Oh, if it was only a noise,' began the Rajah.</p>

<p>'Ah, but the cause, Sire! that was what had to be found out; like the
secret of Swing-ear the Spirit.'</p>

<p>'And who might Swing-ear be?' asked the King.</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Terrible_Bell'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Terrible Bell</b></h4>

<p>&quot;A goblin, your Majesty,&quot; responded Damanaka, &quot;it seemed so, at least,
to the good people of Brahmapoora. A thief had stolen a bell from the
city, and was making off with that plunder, and more, into the
Sri-parvata hills, when he was killed by a tiger. The bell lay in the
jungle till some monkeys picked it up, and amused themselves by
constantly ringing it. The townspeople found the bones of the man, and
heard the noise of the bell all about the hills; so they gave out that
there was a terrible devil there, whose ears rang like bells as he swung
them about, and whose delight was to devour men. Every one, accordingly,
was leaving the town, when a peasant woman named Kar&aacute;la, who liked
belief the better for a little proof, came to the Rajah.</p>

<p>'Highness!' she observed, 'for a consideration I could settle this
Swing-ear.'</p>

<p>'You could!' exclaimed the Rajah.</p>

<p>'I think so!' repeated the woman.</p>

<p>'Give her a consideration forthwith,' said the Rajah.</p>

<p>&quot;Kar&aacute;la, who had her own ideas upon the matter, took the present and set
out. Being come to the hills, she made a circle, and did homage to
Gunputtee,<a name="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> without whom nothing prospers. Then, taking some fruit
she had brought, such as monkeys love extremely, she scattered it up and
down in the wood, and withdrew to watch. Very soon the monkeys finding
the fruit, put down the bell, to do justice to it, and the woman picking
it up, bore it back to the town, where she became an object of uncommon
veneration. We, indeed,&quot; concluded Damanaka, &quot;bring you a Bull instead
of a bell&mdash;your Majesty shall now see him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thereupon Lusty-life was introduced, and, the interview passing off
well, he remained many days in the forest on excellent terms with the
Lion.</p>

<p>'One day another Lion, named 'Stiff-ears,' the brother of King
Tawny-hide, came to visit him. The King received him with all imaginable
respect, bade him be seated, and rose from his throne to go and kill
some beasts for his refreshment.</p>

<p>'May it please your Majesty,' interposed the Bull, 'a deer was slain
to-day&mdash;where is its flesh?'</p>

<p>'Damanaka and his brother know best,' said the King.</p>

<p>'Let us ascertain if there be any,' suggested the Bull.</p>

<p>'It is useless,' said the King, laughing&mdash;'they leave none,'</p>

<p>'What!' exclaimed the Bull, 'have those Jackals eaten a whole deer?'</p>

<p>'Eaten it, spoiled it, and given it away,' answered Tawny-hide; 'they
always do so,'</p>

<p>'And this without your Majesty's sanction?' asked the Bull.</p>

<p>'Oh! certainly not with my sanction,' said the King.</p>

<p>'Then,' exclaimed the Bull, 'it is too bad: and in Ministers too!&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Narrow-necked to let out little, big of belly to keep much,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As a flagon is&mdash;the Vizir of a Sultan should be such.'</span><br />

</div>

<p>'A king's treasury, my liege, is the king's life.'</p>

<p>'Good brother,' observed Stiff-ears, who had heard what the Bull said,
'these Jackals are your Ministers of Home and Foreign Affairs&mdash;they
should not have direction of the Treasury. They are old servants, too,
and you know the saying&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Brahmans, soldiers, these and kinsmen&mdash;of the three set none in charge:</span><br />

</div>

<p>Ministers, my royal brother, are often like obstinate swellings that
want squeezing, and yours must be kept in order.'</p>

<p>'They are not particularly obedient, I confess,' said Tawny-hide.</p>

<p>'It is very wrong,' replied Stiff-ears; 'and if you will be advised by
me&mdash;as we have banqueted enough to-day&mdash;you will appoint this
grain-eating and sagacious Bull your Superintendent of Stores.'</p>

<p>'It shall be so,' exclaimed the King.</p>

<p>'Lusty-life was accordingly appointed to serve out the provisions, and
for many days Tawny-hide showed him favor beyond all others in the
Court.</p>

<p>&quot;Now the Jackals soon found that food was no longer so freely provided
by this arrangement as before, and they met to consult about it.</p>

<p>'It is all our own fault,' said Damanaka, 'and people must suffer for
their own mistakes. You know who said&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>'No!' said Karataka, 'how was it?' Damanaka related:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Prince_and_the_Procuress'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Prince and the Procuress</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In the city of 'Golden-Streets' there reigned a valorous King, named
Vira-vikrama, whose officer of justice was one day taking away to
punishment a certain Barber, when he was stopped by a strolling
mendicant, who held him by the skirts, and cried out, 'Punish not this
man&mdash;punish them that do wrong of their own knowledge.' Being asked his
meaning, he recited the foregoing verses, and, being still further
questioned, he told this story&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I am Prince Kandarpa-ketu, son of the King of Ceylon. Walking one day
in my summer-garden, I heard a merchant-captain narrating how that out
at sea, deep under water, on the fourteenth day of the moon, he had seen
what was like nothing but the famous tree of Paradise, and sitting under
it a lady of most lustrous beauty, bedecked with strings of pearls like
Lukshmi herself, reclining, with a lute in her hands, on what appeared
to be a golden couch crusted all over with precious stones. At once I
engaged the captain and his ship, and steered to the spot of which he
told me. On reaching it I beheld the beautiful apparition as he had
described it, and, transported with the exquisite beauty of the lady, I
leapt after her into the sea. In a moment I found myself in a city of
gold; and in an apartment of a golden palace, surrounded by young and
beautiful girls, I found the Sea-queen. She perceived my approach, and
sent an attendant with a courteous message to meet me. In reply to my
questions, I learned that the lady was the Princess Ratnamanjari,
daughter of the King of All the Spirits&mdash;and how she had made a vow that
whoever should first come to see her golden city, with his own eyes,
should marry her. So I married her by the form called Gundharva, or
'Union by mutual consent,' and spent many and happy days in her
delightful society. One day she took me aside, and said, 'Dear Prince!
all these delights, and I myself, are thine to enjoy; only that picture
yonder, of the Fairy Streak-o'-Gold, that thou must never touch!' For a
long time I observed this injunction; at last, impelled by resistless
curiosity, I laid my hand on the picture of 'Streak-o'-Gold,' In one
instant her little foot, lovely as the lotus-blossom, advanced from out
of the painting, and launched me through sea and air into my own
country. Since that I have been a miserable wanderer; and passing
through this city, I chanced to lodge at a Cowkeeper's hut, and saw the
truth of this Barber's affair. The herdsman returned at night with his
cattle, and found his wife talking with the wife of the Barber, who is
no better than a bawd. Enraged at this, the man beat his wife, tied her
to the milking-post, and fell asleep. In the dead of the night the
Barber's wife came back, and said to the woman, 'He, whom thou knowest,
is burnt with the cruel fire of thine absence, and lies nigh to death;
go therefore and console him, and I will tie myself to the post until
thou returnest.' This was done, and the Cowkeeper presently awoke. 'Ah!
thou light thing!' he said jeeringly, 'why dost not thou keep promise,
and meet thy gallant?' The Barber's wife could make no reply; whereat
becoming incensed, the man cried out, 'What! dost thou scorn to speak to
me? I will cut thy nose off!' And so he did, and then lay down to sleep
again. Very soon the Cowkeeper's wife came back and asked if 'all was
well.' 'Look at my face!' said the Barber's wife, 'and you will see if
all is well.' The woman could do nothing but take her place again,
while the Barber's wife, picking up the severed nose, and at a sad loss
how to account for it, went to her house. In the morning, before it was
light, the Barber called to her to bring his box of razors, and she
bringing one only, he flung it away in a passion. 'Oh, the knave!' she
cried out, directly, aloud, 'Neighbors, neighbors! he has cut my nose
off!' and so she took him before the officers. The Cowkeeper, meantime,
wondering at his wife's patience, made some inquiry about her nose;
whereto she replied, 'Cruel wretch! thou canst not harm a virtuous
woman. If Yama and the seven guardians of the world know me chaste, then
be my face unmaimed!' The herdsman hastened to fetch a light, and
finding her features unaltered, he flung himself at her feet, and begged
forgiveness. For,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Never tires the fire of burning, never wearies death of slaying,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor the sea of drinking rivers, nor the bright-eyed of betraying,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Thereupon the King's officer dismissed Kandarpa-ketu, and did justice by
setting the Barber free, shaving the head of the Barber's wife, and
punishing the Cowkeeper's.</p>

<p>'That is my story,' concluded Damanaka, 'and thence I said that we had
no reason to complain.'</p>

<p>'Well, but we must do something,' said Karataka.</p>

<p>'Yes! How shall we break the friendship of the King with the Bull?'
asked the other.</p>

<p>'It is very strong,' observed Karataka.</p>

<p>'But we can do it,' replied the other.</p>

<p>&quot;A pair of Crows had their abode in a certain tree, the hollow of which
was occupied by a black snake, who had often devoured their young. The
Hen-bird, finding herself breeding again, thus addressed her mate:
'Husband, we must leave this tree; we shall never rear young ones while
this black snake lives here! You know the saw&mdash;</p>

<p>'My dear,' replied the Crow, 'you need not fear; I have put up with him

<p>'How can you fight with a great black snake like that?' said the
Hen-bird.</p>

<p>'How came that about?' asked the Hen-Crow.</p>

<p>'Thus,' replied her mate:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Lion_and_the_Old_Hare'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Lion and the Old Hare</b></h4>

<p>&quot;On the Mandara mountain there lived a Lion named Fierce-of-heart, and
he was perpetually making massacre of all the wild animals. The thing
grew so bad that the beasts held a public meeting, and drew up a
respectful remonstrance to the Lion in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Wherefore should your Majesty thus make carnage of us all? If it may
please you, we ourselves will daily furnish a beast for your Majesty's
meal.&quot; The Lion responded, &quot;If that arrangement is more agreeable to
you, be it so.&quot;; and from that time a beast was allotted to him daily,
and daily devoured. One day it came to the turn of an old hare to supply
the royal table, who reflected to himself as he walked along, &quot;I can but
die, and I will go to my death leisurely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now Fierce-of-heart, the lion, was pinched with hunger, and seeing the
Hare so approaching he roared out, &quot;How darest thou thus delay in
coming?&quot;</p>

<p>'Sire,' replied the Hare, 'I am not to blame. I was detained on the road
by another lion, who exacted an oath from me to return when I should
have informed your Majesty.'</p>

<p>'Go,' exclaimed King Fierce-of-heart in a rage; 'show me, instantly,
where this insolent villain of a lion lives.'</p>

<p>&quot;The Hare led the way accordingly till he came to a deep well, whereat
he stopped, and said, 'Let my lord the King come hither and behold him.'
The Lion approached, and beheld his own reflection in the water of the
well, upon which, in his passion, he directly flung himself, and so
perished.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have heard your story,&quot; said the Hen-Crow, &quot;but what plan do you
propose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear,&quot; replied her mate, &quot;the Rajah's son comes here every day to
bathe in the stream. When he takes off his gold anklet, and lays it on
the stone, do thou bring it in thy beak to the hollow of the tree, and
drop it in there.&quot; Shortly after the Prince came, as was his wont, and
taking off his dress and ornaments, the Hen-Crow did as had been
determined; and while the servants of the Prince were searching in the
hollow, there they found the Black Snake, which they at once dispatched.</p>

<p>'Said I not well,' continued Damanaka, 'that stratagem excels force?'</p>

<p>'It was well said,' replied Karataka; 'go! and may thy path be
prosperous!</p>

<p>'With that Damanaka repaired to the King, and having done homage, thus
addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Your Majesty, there is a dreadful thing on my mind, and I am come to
disclose it.&quot;</p>

<p>'Speak!' said the King, with much graciousness.</p>

<p>'Your Majesty,' said the Jackal, 'this Bull has been detected of
treason. To my face he has spoken contemptuously of the three
prerogatives of the throne,<a name="FNanchor14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> unto which he aspires.'</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Ask who his friends are, ere you scorn your foe;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Wagtail foiled the sea, that did not so,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'How could that be?' demanded King Tawny-hide.</p>

<p>'The Jackal related:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Wagtail_and_the_Sea'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Wagtail and the Sea</b></h4>

<p>&quot;On the shore of the Southern Sea there dwelt a pair of Wagtails. The
Hen-bird was about to lay, and thus addressed her mate:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Husband, we must look about for a fit place to lay my eggs.'</p>

<p>'My dear,' replied the Cock-bird, 'will not this spot do?'</p>

<p>'This spot!' exclaimed the Hen; 'why, the tide overflows it.'</p>

<p>'Good dame,' said the Cock, 'am I so pitiful a fellow that the Sea will
venture to wash the eggs out of my nest?'</p>

<p>'You are my very good Lord,' replied the Hen, with a laugh; 'but still
there is a great difference between you and the Sea.'</p>

<p>&quot;Afterwards, however, at the desire of her mate, she consented to lay
her eggs on the sea-beach. Now the Ocean had overheard all this, and,
bent upon displaying its strength, it rose and washed away the nest and
eggs. Overwhelmed with grief, the Hen-bird flew to her mate, and
cried:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Husband, the terrible disaster has occurred! My eggs arc gone!'</p>

<p>'Be of good heart! my Life,' answered he.</p>

<p>&quot;And therewith he called a meeting of fowls, and went with them into the
presence of Gurud, the Lord of the birds. When the Master of the Mighty
Wing had listened to their complaint, he conveyed it to the knowledge of
the God Narayen, who keeps, and kills, and makes alive the world. The
almighty mandate given, Gurud bound it upon his forehead, and bore it to
the Ocean, which, so soon as it heard the will of Narayen, at once gave
back the eggs.</p>

<p>'How, indeed,' concluded Damanaka, 'should I judge of the Bull's power,
not knowing who supports him?'</p>

<p>'By what signs, then,' asked the King, 'may I conclude him a traitor?'</p>

<p>'If he comes into the presence with his horns lowered for goring, as one
that expects the fight. That,' replied the Jackal, 'will convince your
Majesty,'</p>

<p>'Thereupon Damanaka the Jackal withdrew, and betook himself towards the
Bull, upon perceiving whom he approached slowly, with all the air of one
greatly distressed.</p>

<p>'Good master Jackal,' said Lusty-life, 'what goes amiss with thee?'</p>

<p>'All goes amiss with such as serve wicked masters,' replied the Jackal.</p>

<p>'But what ails thee?' asked the Bull.</p>

<p>'Alas!' answered the Jackal, 'what can I say in such a strait!&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Even as one who grasps a serpent, drowning in the bitter sea,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Death to hold and death to loosen&mdash;such is life's perplexity.'</span><br />

<p>'And therewithal the Jackal heaved a deep sigh, and squatted down.</p>

<p>'But, good friend,' said the Bull, 'at least tell me what is in thy
mind.'</p>

<p>'Bull,' began Damanaka, 'it is a King's secret, and should not be
spoken; but thou didst come here upon my safeguard, and as I hope for
the life to come, I will tell thee of what touches thee so nearly.
Listen!&mdash;the heart of the King is turned against thee! he hath sworn
secretly that he will kill thee and feast upon thy flesh.'</p>

<p>'Then Lusty-life the Bull was sorely troubled, and he fell a-musing
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Woman's love rewards the worthless&mdash;kings of knaves exalters be;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As the sooty soorma pleases, lighted by a brilliant eye.'</span><br />

<p>Then he said aloud, 'wherein can I have angered the King? Do kings hate
without cause? I can tell nothing, except that there is no happiness
which abides long&mdash;</p>

<p>'Bull,' said Damanaka, 'I knew the King of old for one whose tongue was
honey and whose heart was poison.'</p>

<p>'But how very hard!' said the Bull, 'that he, being a lion, should
attack me, an innocent eater of grass!'</p>

<p>'It is very hard!' said the Jackal.</p>

<p>'Who can have set him against me?' asked the Bull.</p>

<p>'Being so, it cannot be bettered,' replied the Jackal, 'whoever did it&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'As a bracelet of crystal, once broke, is not mended;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So the favor of princes, once altered, is ended.'</span><br />

<p>'Yes,' said the Bull, 'and a king incensed is terrible&mdash;</p>

<p>Still, I can but die&mdash;and I will die fighting! When death is certain,
and no hope left but in battle, that is the time for war,'</p>

<p>'It is so,' said the Jackal.</p>

<p>'Having weighed all this, Lusty-life inquired of the Jackal by what
signs he might conclude the King's hostile intentions.</p>

<p>'If he glowers upon thee,' answered Damanaka, 'and awaits thee with ears
pricked, tail stiffened, paw upraised, and muzzle agape, then thou
mayest get thee to thy weapons like a Bull of spirit, for</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On a lifeless heap of ashes fearlessly the foot is set,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Then Damanaka the Jackal returned to the Lion, and said to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>'If it please your Majesty, the traitor is now coming; let your Majesty
be on your guard, with ears pricked and paw upraised.'</p>

<p>'The Bull meanwhile approached, and observing the hostile attitude of
King Tawny-hide, he also lowered his horns, and prepared for the combat.
A terrible battle ensued, and at the last King Tawny-hide slew
Lusty-life the Bull. Now when the Bull was dead, the Lion was very
sorrowful, and as he sat on his throne lamenting, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'I repent me of this deed!&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'As when an Elephant's life-blood is spilt,</span><br />

<p>'Sire,' replied the Jackal, 'a King over-merciful is like a Brahman
that eats all things equally. May all your Majesty's enemies perish as
did this Bull.'</p>

<p>&quot;Thus endeth,&quot; said the Sage Vishnu-Sarman, &quot;the 'Parting of Friends.'&quot;</p>

<p>When the next day of instruction was come, the King's sons spake to the

earnestly desire to hear thee discourse upon War.&quot;</p>

<p>'And how was all that?' asked the sons of the Rajah. Vishnu-Sarman
proceeded to relate&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Battle_of_the_Swans_and_Peacocks'></a><h4><b>The Battle of the Swans and Peacocks</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In the Isle of Camphor there is a lake called 'Lotus-water,' and
therein a Swan-Royal, named 'Silver-sides,' had his residence. The birds
of the marsh and the mere had elected him King, in full council of all
the fowls&mdash;for a people with no ruler is like a ship that is without a
helmsman. One day King Silver-sides, with his courtiers, was quietly
reposing on a couch of well-spread lotus-blossoms, when a Crane, named
'Long-bill,' who had just arrived from foreign parts, entered the
presence with an obeisance, and sat down.</p>

<p>'What news from abroad, Long-bill?' asked his Majesty.</p>

<p>'Great news, may it please you,' answered the Crane, 'and therefore have
I hastened hither. Will your Majesty hear me?'</p>

<p>'Speak!' said King Silver-sides.</p>

<p>'You must know, my Liege,' began the Crane, 'that over all the birds of
the Vindhya mountains in Jambudwipa a Peacock is King, and his name is
'Jewel-plume,' I was looking for food about a certain burnt jungle
there, when some of his retainers discovered me, and asked my name and
country. 'I am a vassal of King Silver-sides, Lord of the Island of
Camphor,' I replied, 'and I am travelling in foreign lands for my
pleasure.' Upon that the birds asked me which country, my own or theirs,
and which King, appeared to me superior. 'How can you ask?' I replied;
'the island of Camphor is, as it were, Heaven itself, and its King a
heaven-born ruler. To dwellers in a barren land like yours how can I
describe them? Come for yourselves, and see the country where I live.'
Thereupon, your Majesty, the birds were exceedingly offended, as one
might expect&mdash;</p>

<p>The Crane related:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Weaver_Birds_and_the_Monkeys'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Weaver-Birds and the Monkeys</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In a nullah that leads down to the Nerbudda river there stood a large
silk-cotton tree, where a colony of weaver-birds had built their hanging
nests, and lived snugly in them, whatever the weather. It was in the
rainy season, when the heavens are overlaid with clouds like
indigo-sheets, and a tremendous storm of water was falling. The birds
looked out from their nests, and saw some monkeys, shivering and starved
with the cold, standing under a tree. 'Twit! twit! you Monkeys,' they
began to chirrup. 'Listen to us!&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'With beaks we built these nests, of fibres scattered;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>You that have hands and feet, build, or be spattered.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>On hearing that the Monkeys were by no means pleased. 'Ho! ho!' said
they, 'the Birds in their snug nests are jeering at us; wait till the
rain is over,' Accordingly, so soon as the weather mended, the Monkeys
climbed into the tree, and broke all the birds' eggs and demolished
every nest. I ought to have known better,' concluded the Crane, 'than to
have wasted my suggestions on King Jewel-plume's creatures.'</p>

<p>'But what did they say?' asked Silver-sides.</p>

<p>'They said, Rajah,' answered the Crane, 'who made that Swan of thine a
King?'</p>

<p>'And what was your reply?' asked Silver-sides.</p>

<p>'I demanded,' replied the Crane, 'who made a King of that Peacock of
theirs. Thereupon they were ready to kill me for rage; but I displayed
my very best valor. Is it not written&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yet a man should measure his own strength first,' said the Rajah,
smiling; 'how did you fare against King Jewel-plume's fellows?'</p>

<p>'Very scurvily,' replied Long-bill. &quot;Thou rascal Crane,&quot; they cried,
&quot;dost thou feed on his soil, and revile our Sovereign? That is past
bearing!&quot; And thereat they all pecked at me. Then they began again:
&quot;Thou thick-skulled Crane! that King of thine is a goose&mdash;a web-footed

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Old_Hare_and_the_Elephants'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Old Hare and the Elephants</b></h4>

<p>&quot;Once on a time, very little rain had fallen in the due season; and the
Elephants being oppressed with thirst, thus accosted their
leader:&mdash;'Master, how are we to live? The small creatures find something
to wash in, but we cannot, and we are half dead in consequence; whither
shall we go then, and what shall we do?' Upon that the King of the
Elephants led them away a little space; and showed them a beautiful pool
of crystal water, where they took their ease. Now it chanced that a
company of Hares resided on the banks of the pool, and the going and
coming of the elephants trampled many of them to death, till one of
their number named Hard-head grumbled out, 'This troop will be coming
here to water every day, and every one of our family will be crushed.'
'Do not disquiet yourself,' said an old buck named Good-speed, 'I will
contrive to avert it,' and so saying, he set off, bethinking himself on
his way how he should approach and accost a herd of elephants; for,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Elephants destroy by touching, snakes with point of tooth beguile;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kings by favor kill, and traitors murder with a fatal smile.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'I will get on the top of a hill,' he thought, 'and address the
Elephants thence.'</p>

<p>&quot;This being done, and the Lord of the herd perceiving him, it was asked
of the Hare, 'Who art thou? and whence comest thou?'</p>

<p>'I am an ambassador from his Godship the Moon,' replied Good-speed.</p>

<p>'State your business,' said the Elephant-king.</p>

<p>'Sire,' began the Hare, 'an ambassador speaks the truth safely by
charter of his name. Thus saith the Moon, then: &quot;These hares were the
guardians of my pool, and thine elephants in coming thither have scared
them away. This is not well. Am I not Sasanka, whose banner bears a
hare, and are not these hares my votaries?&quot;'</p>

<p>'Please your worship,' said the Elephant-king with much trepidation, 'we
knew nothing of this; we will go there no more.'</p>

<p>'It were well,' said the sham ambassador, 'that you first made your
apologies to the Divinity, who is quaking with rage in his pool, and
then went about your business.'</p>

<p>'We will do so,' replied the Elephant with meekness; and being led by
night to the pool, in the ripples of which the image of the Moon was
quivering, the herd made their prostrations; the Hare explaining to the
Moon that their fault was done in ignorance, and thereupon they got
their dismissal.'</p>

<p>'Nay,' I said, 'my Sovereign is no fiction, but a great King and a
noble, and one that might govern the Three Worlds, much more a kingdom,'</p>

<p>'Thou shalt talk thy treason in the presence,' they cried; and therewith
I was dragged before King Jewel-plume.</p>

<p>'Who is this?' asked the Rajah.</p>

<p>'He is a servant of King Silver-sides, of the Island of Camphor,' they
replied; 'and he slights your Majesty, on your Majesty's own land.'</p>

<p>'Sirrah Crane!' said the Prime Minister, a Vulture, 'who is chief
officer in that court?'</p>

<p>'A Brahmany Goose,' I answered, 'named &quot;Know-all&quot;; and he does know
every possible science.'</p>

<p>'Sire,' broke in a Parrot, 'this Camphor-isle and the rest are poor
places, and belong to Jambudwipa. Your Majesty has but to plant the
royal foot upon them.'</p>

<p>'Oh! of course,' said the King.</p>

<p>'Nay,' said I, 'if talking makes your Majesty King of Camphor-island, my
Liege may be lord of Jambudwipa by a better title.'</p>

<p>'And that?' said the Parrot.</p>

<p>'Is fighting!' I responded.</p>

<p>'Good!' said the King, with a smile; 'bid your people prepare for war.'</p>

<p>'Not so,' I replied; 'but send your own ambassador.'</p>

<p>'The high-road to Oogein is a very unshaded and sultry one; but there
stands upon it one large Peepul-tree, and therein a Crow and a Heron had
their residence together. It was in the hot weather that a tired
traveller passed that way, and, for the sake of the shade, he laid his
bow and arrows down, and dropped asleep under the tree. Before long the
shadow of the tree shifted, and left his face exposed to the glare;
which the Heron perceiving, like the kindly bird he was, perched on the
Peepul-tree, and spread his wings out so as to cast a shadow on the
traveller's face. There the poor fellow, weary with his travel,
continued to sleep soundly, and snored away comfortably with open mouth.
The sight of his enjoyment was too much for the malevolent Crow, who,
perching over him, dropped an unwelcome morsel into the sleeper's mouth,
and straightway flew off. The traveller, starting from his slumber,
looked about, and, seeing no bird but the Heron, he fitted an arrow and
shot him dead. No!' concluded the Parrot, 'I like the society of honest

<p>&quot;There was a Wheelwright in Shri-nuggur, whose name was 'Heavy-head,' He
had good reason to suspect the infidelity of his wife, but he had no
absolute proof of it. One day he gave out that he should go to a
neighboring town, and he started accordingly; but he went a very little
way, and then returning, hid himself in his wife's chamber. She being
quite satisfied that he was really gone away, invited her gallant to
pass the evening with her, and began to spend it with him in
unrestrained freedom. Presently, by chance, she detected the presence of
her husband, and her manner instantly changed.</p>

<p>'Life of my soul! what ails you?' said her lover; 'you are quite dull
to-night.'</p>

<p>'I am dull,' she replied,' because the lord of my life is gone. Without
my husband the town is a wilderness. Who knows what may befall him, and
whether he will have a nice supper?'</p>

<p>'Trouble thyself no more about the quarrelsome dullard,' said her
gallant.</p>

<p>'Dullard, quotha!' exclaimed the wife. 'What matter what he is, since he
is my all? Knowest thou not&mdash;</p>

<p>Thou, and the like of thee, may serve a whim, as we chew a betel-leaf
and trifle with a flower; but my husband is my master, and can do with
me as he will. My life is wrapped up in him&mdash;and when he dies, alas! I
will certainly die too. Is it not plainly said&mdash;</p>

'to have a wife so virtuous,' and rushing from his place of concealment,
he exclaimed in ecstasy to his wife's gallant, 'Sir I saw you ever truer
wife than mine?'</p>

<p>'When the story was concluded,' said Long-bill, 'the King, with a
gracious gift of food, sent me off before the Parrot; but he is coming
after me, and it is now for your Majesty to determine as it shall please

which is that of a fool.'</p>

<p>&quot;Let the past pass,&quot; replied the King, &quot;and take thought for the
present.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be it in secret, then, your Majesty,&quot; said the Brahmany-goose&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Counsel unto six ears spoken, unto all is notified:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When a King holds consultation, let it be with one beside,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Thereupon all withdrew, but the Rajah and the Minister.</p>

<p>'What think you?' said Silver-sides.</p>

<p>'That the Crane has been employed to bring this about,' replied the
other.</p>

<p>'What shall we do?' asked the King.</p>

<p>'Despatch two spies&mdash;the first to inform and send back the other, and
make us know the enemy's strength or weakness. They must be such as can
travel by land and water, so the Crane will serve for one, and we will
keep his family in pledge at the King's gate. The other must be a very
reserved character; as it is said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Sick men are for skilful leeches&mdash;prodigals for prisoning&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fools for teachers&mdash;and the man who keeps a secret, for a King,'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'I know such a one,' said his Majesty, after a pause.</p>

<p>'It is half the victory,' responded the Minister.</p>

<p>At this juncture a chamberlain entered with a profound obeisance, and
announced the arrival from Jambudwipa of the Parrot.</p>

<p>'Let him be shown to a reception-room,' commanded the Goose, in reply to
a look from the King. 'He shall presently have audience.'</p>

<p>'War is pronounced, then,' said the King, as the attendant withdrew.</p>

<p>'It is offered, my Liege; but must not be rashly accepted,' replied the
other&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'With gift, craft, promise, cause thy foe to yield;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When these have failed thee, challenge him a-field.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>To gain time for expedients is the first point. Expedients are good for
great and little matters equally, like</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'The subtle wash of waves, that smoothly pass,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But lay the tree as lowly as the grass.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Let his Excellency the Parrot, then, be cajoled and detained here, while
we place our fort in condition to be useful. Is it not said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Ten true bowmen on a rampart fifty's onset may sustain;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fortalices keep a country more than armies in the plain?'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And your Majesty,' continued the Goose, 'will recall the points of a
good fortress&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Build it strong, and build it spacious, with an entry and retreat;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Store it well with wood and water, fill its garners full with wheat.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Whom, then, shall we entrust with this work?' asked King Silver-sides.</p>

<p>'The Paddy-bird<a name="FNanchor18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> is a good bird, and a skilful,' replied his
Minister.</p>

<p>'Let him be summoned!' said the King. And upon the entrance of the
Paddy-bird, the superintendence of the fortress was committed to him,
and accepted with a low prostration.</p>

<p>'As to the fort, Sire!' remarked the Paddy-bird, 'it exists already in
yonder large pool; the thing is to store the island in the middle of it
with provisions&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Gems will no man's life sustain;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Best of gold is golden grain.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Good!' said King Silver-sides; 'let it be looked to.' Thereupon, as the
Paddy-bird was retiring, the Usher entered again, and making
prostration, said: 'May it please your Majesty, the King of all the
Crows, Night-cloud by name, has just arrived from Singhala-dwipa, and
desires to lay his homage at your Majesty's feet.'</p>

<p>'He is a wise bird, and a far-travelled,' said the King; 'I think we
must give him audience.'</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Sire,' interrupted the Goose, 'we must not forget that he
is a land-bird, and therefore not to be received as a water-fowl. Your
royal memory doubtless retains the story of</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'The Jackal's fate, who being colored blue,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Leaving his party, left his own life too.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'No! How was that?' asked King Silver-sides. The Goose related&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Dyed_Jackal'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Dyed Jackal</b></h4>

<p>&quot;A Jackal once on a time, as he was prowling about the suburbs of a
town, slipped into an indigo-tank; and not being able to get out he laid
himself down so as to be taken for dead. The dyer presently coming and
finding what seemed a dead Jackal, carried him into the jungle and then
flung him away. Left to himself, the Jackal found his natural color
changed to a splendid blue. 'Really,' he reflected, 'I am now of a most
magnificent tint; why should I not make it conduce to my elevation?'
With this view, he assembled the other Jackals, and thus harangued
them:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good people, the Goddess of the Wood, with her own divine hand, and
with every magical herb of the forest, has anointed me King. Behold the
complexion of royalty!&mdash;and henceforward transact nothing without my
imperial permission.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Jackals, overcome by so distinguished a color, could do nothing but
prostrate themselves and promise obedience. His reign, thus begun,
extended in time to the lions and tigers; and with these high-born
attendants he allowed himself to despise the Jackals, keeping his own
kindred at a distance, as though ashamed of them. The Jackals were
indignant, but an old beast of their number thus consoled them:&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Leave the impudent fellow to me. I will contrive his ruin. These tigers
and the rest think him a King, because he is colored blue; we must show
them his true colors. Do this, now!&mdash;in the evening-time come close
about him, and set up a great yell together&mdash;he is sure to join in, as
he used to do&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Hard it is to conquer nature: if a dog were made a King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mid the coronation trumpets, he would gnaw his sandal-string.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And when he yells the Tigers will know him for a Jackal and fall upon
him.'</p>

<p>'The thing befell exactly so, and the Jackal,' concluded the Minister,
'met the fate of one who leaves his proper party.'</p>

<p>'Still,' said the King, 'the Crow has come a long way, and we might see
him, I think.'</p>

<p>'Admit the Parrot first, Sire,' said the Goose; 'the fort has been put
in order and the spy despatched.'</p>

<p>&quot;Thereupon a Court was called, and the Parrot introduced, followed by
Night-cloud, the Crow. A seat was offered to the parrot, who took it,
and, with his beak in the air, thus delivered his mission:&mdash;</p>

<p>'King Silver-sides!&mdash;My master, the King Jewel-plume, Lord of Lords,
bids thee, if life and lands be dear to thee, to come and make homage at
his august feet; and failing this to get thee gone from Camphor-island.'</p>

<p>'S'death!' exclaimed the Rajah, 'is there none that will silence this
traitor?'</p>

<p>'Give the sign, your Majesty,' said the Crow, starting up, and I will
despatch this audacious bird.'</p>

<p>'Sir,' said the Goose, 'be calm! and Sire, deign to listen&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis no Council where no Sage is&mdash;'tis no Sage that fears not Law;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis no Law which Truth confirms not&mdash;'tis no Truth which Fear can awe.'</span><br />

<p>An ambassador must speak unthreatened&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Though base be the Herald, nor hinder nor let,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>For the mouth of a king is he;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The sword may be whet, and the battle set,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But the word of his message is free.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Thereat the Rajah and Night-cloud resumed their composure; and the
Parrot took his departure, escorted by the Minister, and presented with
complimentary gifts of gold and jewels. On reaching the palace of
Jewel-plume, the King demanded his tidings, and inquired of the country
he had visited.</p>

<p>'War must be prepared, may it please you,' said the Parrot: 'the
country is a country of Paradise.'</p>

<p>'Prepare for war, then!' said the King.</p>

<p>'We must not enter on it in the face of destiny,' interposed the
Vulture-Minister, whose title was 'Far-sight.'</p>

<p>'Let the Astrologer then discover a favorable conjuncture for the
expedition, and let my forces be reviewed meantime,' said the King.</p>

<p>'We must not march without great circumspection,' observed Far-sight.</p>

<p>'Minister!' exclaimed the King, 'you chafe me. Say, however, with what
force we should set out.'</p>

<p>'It should be well selected, rather than unwieldy,' replied the
Vulture&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Better few and chosen fighters than of shaven crowns a host,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For in headlong flight confounded, with the base the brave are lost.'</span><br />

<p>And its commanders must be judiciously appointed; for it is said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Ever absent, harsh, unjustly portioning the captured prey&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These, and cold or laggard leaders make a host to melt away.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Ah!' interrupted the Rajah, 'what need of so much talk? We will go,
and, if V&aacute;chaspati please, we will conquer.'</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the Spy returned to Camphor-island. 'King
Silver-sides,' he cried, 'the Rajah, Jewel-plume, is on his way hither,
and has reached the Ghauts. Let the fort be manned, for that Vulture is
a great minister; and I have learned, too, that there is one among us
who is in his pay.'</p>

<p>'King!' said the Goose, 'that must be the Crow.'</p>

<p>'But whence, then, did he show such willingness to punish the Parrot?'
objected his Majesty. 'Besides, war was declared long after the Crow
came to Court.'</p>

<p>'I misdoubt him,' said the Minister, 'because he is a stranger.'</p>

<p>'But strangers surely may be well-disposed,' replied the King. 'How say
the books?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Kind is kin, howe'er a stranger&mdash;kin unkind is stranger shown;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sores hurt, though the body breeds them&mdash;drugs relieve, though desert-grown.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Have you never heard of King Sudraka and the unknown Servant, who gave
his son's life for the King?</p>

<p>'Never,' answered the Goose.</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Faithful_Rajpoot'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Faithful Rajpoot</b></h4>

<p>&quot;I will tell you the tale,&quot; said the King, &quot;as I heard it from
'Lilyflower,' daughter of the Flamingo 'White-flag,' of whom I was once
very fond:&mdash;A soldier presented himself one morning at King Sudraka's
gate, and bade the porter procure an audience for 'Vira-vara, a
Rajpoot,'<a name="FNanchor19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> who sought employment. Being admitted to the presence, he
thus addressed the King:&mdash;</p>

<p>'If your Highness needs an attendant, behold one!'</p>

<p>'What pay do you ask?' inquired the King.</p>

<p>'Five hundred pieces of gold a day,' said Vira-vara.</p>

<p>'And your accoutrements?' asked the King.</p>

<p>'Are these two arms, and this sabre, which serve for a third,' said
Vira-vara, rolling up his sleeve.</p>

<p>'I cannot entertain you,' rejoined his Majesty; and thereupon the
Rajpoot made salaam, and withdrew. Then said the Ministers, 'If it
please your Majesty, the stipend is excessive, but give him pay for four
days, and see wherein he may deserve it.' Accordingly, the Rajpoot was
recalled, and received wages for four days, with the complimentary
betel.&mdash;Ah! the rare betel! Truly say the wise of it&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Betel-nut is bitter, hot, sweet, spicy, binding, alkaline&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A demulcent&mdash;an astringent&mdash;foe to evils intestine;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Giving to the breath a fragrance&mdash;to the lips a crimson red;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A detergent, and a kindler of Love's flame that lieth dead.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Praise the gods for the good Betel!&mdash;these be thirteen virtues given,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hard to meet in one thing blended, even in their happy heaven.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Now the King narrowly watched the spending of Vira-vara's pay, and
discovered that he bestowed half in the service of the Gods and the
support of Brahmans, a fourth part in relieving the poor, and reserved a
fourth for his sustenance and recreation. This daily division made, he
would take his stand with his sabre at the gate of the palace; retiring
only upon receiving the royal permission.</p>

<p>'It was on the fourteenth night of the dark half of the month that King
Sudraka heard below a sound of passionate sobbing. 'Ho! there,' he
cried, 'who waits at the gate?'</p>

<p>'I,' replied Vira-vara, 'may it please you.'</p>

<p>'Go and learn what means this weeping,' said the King.</p>

<p>'I go, your Majesty, answered the Rajpoot, and therewith departed.</p>

<p>'No sooner was he gone than the King repented him of sending one man
alone into a night so dark that a bodkin might pierce a hole in it, and
girding on his scimitar, he followed his guard beyond the city gates.
When Vira-vara had gone thus far he encountered a beautiful and
splendidly dressed lady who was weeping bitterly; and accosting her, he
requested to know her name, and why she thus lamented.</p>

<p>'I am the Fortune of the King Sudraka,' answered she; 'a long while I
have lived happily in the shadow of his arm; but on the third day he
will die, and I must depart, and therefore lament I.'</p>

<p>'Can nothing serve, Divine Lady, to prolong thy stay?' asked the
Rajpoot.</p>

<p>'It might be,' replied the Spirit, 'if thou shouldst cut off the head of
thy first-born Shaktidhar, that hath on his body the thirty-two
auspicious marks of greatness. Were his head offered to the all-helpful
Durga, the Rajah should live a hundred years, and I might tarry beside
him.'</p>

<p>'So speaking, she disappeared, and Vira-vara retraced his steps to his
own house and awoke his wife and son. They arose, and listened with
attention until Vira-vara had repeated all the words of the vision. When
he had finished, Shaktidhar exclaimed, 'I am thrice happy to be able to
save the state of the King. Kill me, my father, and linger not; to give
my life in such a cause is good indeed,' 'Yes,' said the Mother, 'it is
good, and worthy of our blood; how else should we deserve the King's
pay?' Being thus agreed, they repaired together at once to the temple of
the Goddess Durga, and having paid their devotions and entreated the
favor of the deity on behalf of the King, Vira-vara struck off his son's
head, and laid it as an offering upon the shrine. That done, Vira-vara
said, 'My service to the King is accomplished, and life without my boy
is but a burden,' and therewith he plunged his sword in his own breast
and fell dead. Overpowered with grief for her husband and child, the
mother also withdrew the twice-blooded weapon, and slew herself with it
on the bodies of Vira-vara and Shaktidhar.</p>

<p>'All this was heard and seen by King Sudraka, and he stood aghast at the
sad sight. 'Woe is me!' he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Kings may come, and Kings may go;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What was I, to bring these low?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Souls so noble, slain for me,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were not, and will never be!'</span><br />
</div>

<p>What reck I of my realm, having lost these?' and thereat he drew his
scimitar to take his own life also. At that moment there appeared to him
the Goddess, who is Mistress of all men's fortunes. 'Son,' said she,
staying his lifted hand, 'forbear thy rash purpose, and bethink thee of
thy kingdom.'</p>

<p>&quot;The Rajah fell prostrate before her, and cried&mdash;'O Goddess! I am done
with life and wealth and kingdom! If thou hast compassion on me, let my
death restore these faithful ones to life; anywise I follow the path
they have marked,' 'Son,' replied the Goddess, 'thine affection is
pleasing to me: be it as thou wilt! The Rajpoot and his house shall be
rendered alive to thee.' Then the King departed, and presently saw
Vira-vara return, and take up again his station as before at the
palace-gate.</p>

<p>'Ho! there, Vira-vara!' cried the King, 'what meant the weeping?'</p>

<p>'Let your Majesty rest well!' answered the Rajpoot, 'it was a woman who
wept, and disappeared on my approach.' This answer completed the Rajah's
astonishment and delight; for we know&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'He is brave whose tongue is silent of the trophies of his sword;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He is great whose quiet bearing marks his greatness well assured.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>So when the day was come, he called a full council, and, declaring
therein all the events of the night, he invested the faithful guard with
the sovereignty of the Carnatic.</p>

<p>&quot;Thus, then,&quot; concluded King Silver-sides, &quot;in entertaining strangers a
man may add to his friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It may well be,&quot; replied the Goose; &quot;but a Minister should advise what
is expedient, and not what is pleasing in sentiment:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'When the Priest, the Leech, the Vizir of a King his flatterers be,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Very soon the King will part with health, and wealth, and piety.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Let it pass, then,' said Silver-sides, 'and turn we to the matter in
hand. King Jewel-plume is even now pitched under the Ghauts. What think
you?'</p>

<p>'That we shall vanquish him,' replied the Goose; 'for he disregards, as
I learn, the counsel of that great statesman, the Vulture Far-sight; and
the wise have said&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Merciless, or money-loving, deaf to counsel, false of faith,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thoughtless, spiritless, or careless, changing course with every breath,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ripe for meeting and defeating, certes he would choose him so.</span><br />
</div>

<p>He is marching without due preparation; let us send the Paddy-bird at
the head of a force and attack him on his march.&quot;</p>

<p>Accordingly the Paddy-bird, setting out with a force of water-fowl, fell
upon the host of the Peacock-king, and did immense execution.
Disheartened thereat, King Jewel-plume summoned Far-sight, his Minister,
and acknowledged to him his precipitation.</p>

<p>'Wherefore do you abandon us, my father?' he said. 'Correct for us what
has been done amiss.</p>

<p>'My Liege,' replied the Vulture, 'it has been well observed&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'By the valorous and unskilful great achievements are not wrought;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Courage, led by careful Prudence, unto highest ends is brought.'</span><br />

clumsily spoiled your plans. How indeed could it fall otherwise? for&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Grief kills gladness, winter summer, midnight-gloom the light of day,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Than Impolicy of Fortune&mdash;of Misfortune Policy.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>I have said to myself, 'My Prince's understanding is affected&mdash;how else
would he obscure the moonlight of policy with the night-vapors of talk;'
in such a mood I cannot help him&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Wisdom answers all who ask her, but a fool she cannot aid;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Blind men in the faithful mirror see not their reflection made.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And therefore I have been absent.'</p>

<p>'My father!' said the King, joining his palms in respect, 'mine is all
the fault! Pardon it, and instruct me how to withdraw my army without
further loss.'</p>

<p>Then the Vulture's anger melted, and he reflected&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Where the Gods are, or thy Guru&mdash;in the face of Pain and Age,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Cattle, Brahmans, Kings, and Children&mdash;reverently curb thy rage.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>And with a benignant smile, he answered the King thus, 'Be of good
heart, my Liege; thou shalt not only bring the host back safely, but
thou shalt first destroy the castle of King Silver-sides.'</p>

<p>'How can that be, with my diminished forces?' asked the Rajah.</p>

<p>'It will come to pass!' answered the Vulture. 'Break up to-day for the
blockade of the fort.'</p>

<p>Now, when this was reported by the spies to King Silver-sides, he was
greatly alarmed. 'Good Goose!' said he, 'what is to be done? Here is the
King of the Peacocks at hand, to blockade us&mdash;by his Minister's advice,
too.'</p>

<p>'Sire,' replied the Goose, 'separate the efficient and the inefficient
in your force; and stimulate the loyalty of the first, with a royal
bounty of gold and dresses, as each may seem to merit. Now is the time
for it&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Oh, my Prince! on eight occasions prodigality is none&mdash;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or to do a mistress honor, or to welcome back a friend.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'But is this expenditure needed?' said the King.</p>

<p>'It is needed, my Liege,' said the Goose, 'and it befits a Monarch;
for&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Truth, munificence, and valor, are the virtues of a King;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Royalty, devoid of either, sinks to a rejected thing.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Let it be incurred then!' replied the King.</p>

<p>At this moment Night-cloud, the Crow, made his appearance. 'Deign me one
regard, Sire,' said he, 'the insolent enemy is at our gates; let your
Majesty give the word, and I will go forth and show my valor and
devotion to your Crown.'</p>

<p>'It were better to keep our cover,' said the Goose. 'Wherefore else
builded we this fortalice? Is it not said?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Hold thy vantage!&mdash;alligators on the land make none afraid;</span><br />

</div>

<p>But go, your Majesty, and encourage our warriors.&quot; Thereupon they
repaired to the Gateway of the Fort, and all day the battle raged there.</p>

<p>It was the morning after, when King Jewel-plume spake thus to his
Minister the Vulture&mdash;'Good sir, shall thy promise be kept to us?'</p>

<p>'It shall be kept, your Majesty,' replied the Vulture; 'storm the fort!'</p>

<p>'We will storm it!' said the Peacock-king. The sun was not well-risen
accordingly when the attack was made, and there arose hot fighting at
all the four gates. It was then that the traitorous Crows, headed by
their Monarch, Night-cloud, put fire to every dwelling in the citadel,
and raised a shout of 'The Fort is taken! it is taken!' At this terrible
sound the soldiers of the Swan-king forsook their posts, and plunged
into the pool.</p>

<p>Not thus King Silver-sides:&mdash;retiring coolly before the foe, with his
General the Paddy-bird, he was cut off and encircled by the troopers of
King Jewel-plume, under the command of his Marshal, the Cock.</p>

<p>'My General,' said the King, 'thou shalt not perish for me. Fly! I can
go no farther. Fly! I bid thee, and take counsel with the Goose that
Crest-jewel, my son, be named King!'</p>

<p>'Good my Lord,' replied the Paddy-bird, 'speak not thus! Let your
Majesty reign victorious while the sun and moon endure. I am governor of
your Majesty's fortress, and if the enemy enter it he shall but do so
over my body; let me die for thee, my Master!&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Gentle, generous, and discerning; such a Prince the Gods do give!'</span><br />

<p>'That shalt thou not,' replied the Rajah&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Skilful, honest, and true-hearted; where doth such a Vassal live?'</span><br /></div>

<p>'Nay! my royal Lord, escape!' cried the Paddy-bird; a king's life is the
life of his people&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'The people are the lotus-leaves, their monarch is the sun&mdash;</span><br />

</div>

<p>'Think no more of me.' At this instant the Cock rushing forward,
inflicted a wound with his sharp spurs on the person of the King; but
the Paddy-bird sprang in front of him, and receiving on his body the
blows designed for the Rajah, forced him away into the pool. Then
turning upon the Cock, he despatched him with a shower of blows from his
long bill; and finally succumbed, fighting in the midst of his enemies.
Thus the King of the Peacocks captured the fortress; and marched home
with all the treasure in it, amid songs of victory.</p>

<p>Then spake the Princes: &quot;In that army of the Swans there was no soldier
like the Paddy-bird, who gave his own life for the King's.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is a pool in South Behar called the 'Pool of the Blue Lotus,' and
two Geese had for a long time lived there. They had a friend in the pool
who was a Tortoise, and he was known as 'Shelly-neck,' It chanced one
evening that the Tortoise overheard some fishermen talking by the water.
'We will stop here to-night,' they said, 'and in the morning we will
catch the fish, the tortoises, and such like.' Extremely alarmed at
this, the Tortoise repaired to his friends the Geese, and reported the
conversation.</p>

<p>'What ever am I to do, Gossips?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The first thing is to be assured of the danger,' said the Geese.</p>

<p>'I am assured,' exclaimed the Tortoise; 'the first thing is to avoid it:

<p>&quot;It was just such a pool as this, and on the arrival at it of just such
men as these fishermen, that three fishes, who had heard their designs,
held consultation as to what should be done.</p>

<p>'I shall go to another water,' said &quot;Time-not-come,&quot; and away he went.</p>

<p>'Why should we leave unless obliged?' asked &quot;Quick-at-peril.&quot; 'When the

<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Unabashed_Wife'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Unabashed Wife</b></h4>

<p>&quot;There was a trader in Vikrama-poora, who had a very beautiful wife, and
her name was Jewel-bright. The lady was as unfaithful as she was fair,
and had chosen for her last lover one of the household servants. Ah!
womankind!&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Sex, that tires of being true,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Changing food for sake of change.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Now it befell one day that as Jewel-bright was bestowing a kiss on the
mouth of the servant, she was surprised by her husband; and seeing him
she ran up hastily and said, 'My lord, here is an impudent varlet! he
eats the camphor which I procured for you; I was actually smelling it on
his lips as you entered.' The servant catching her meaning, affected
offence. 'How can a man stay in a house where the mistress is always
smelling one's lips for a little camphor?' he said; and thereat he was
for going off, and was only constrained by the good man to stay, after
much entreaty. 'Therefore,' said Quick-at-peril, 'I mean to abide here,
and make the best I can of what befalls, as she did.'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' said What-will-be-will-be, 'we all know</p>

<p>'When the morning came, the net was thrown, and both the fishes
inclosed. Quick-at-peril, on being drawn up, feigned himself dead; and
upon the fisherman's laying him aside, he leaped off again into the
water. As to What-will-be-will-be, he was seized and forthwith
dispatched.&mdash;And that,' concluded the Tortoise, 'is why I wish to devise
some plan of escape.'</p>

<p>'It might be compassed if you could go elsewhere,' said the Geese, 'but
how can you get across the ground?'</p>

<p>'Can't you take me through the air?' asked the Tortoise.</p>

<p>'Impossible!' said the Geese.</p>

<p>'Not at all!' replied the Tortoise; 'you shall hold a stick across in
your bills, and I will hang on to it by my mouth&mdash;and thus you can
readily convey me,'</p>

<p>'It is feasible,' observed the Geese, 'but remember,</p>

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Herons_and_the_Mongoose'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Herons and the Mongoose</b></h4>

<p>&quot;Among the mountains of the north there is one named Eagle-cliff, and
near it, upon a fig-tree, a flock of Herons had their residence. At the
foot of the tree, in a hollow, there lived a serpent; and he was
constantly devouring the nestlings of the Herons. Loud were the
complaints of the parent birds, until an old Heron thus advised
them:&mdash;'You should bring some fishes from the pool, and lay them one by
one in a line from the hole of yonder Mongoose to the hollow where the
Serpent lives. The Mongoose will find him when it comes after the fish,
and if it finds him it will kill him.' The advice seemed good, and was
acted upon; but in killing the Snake the Mongoose overheard the cry of
the young Herons; and climbing the tree daily, he devoured all that the
Snake had left. Therefore,' concluded the Geese, 'do we bid you look
well into your plan: if you should open your mouth, for instance, as we
carry you, you will drop and be killed.'</p>

<p>'Am I a fool,' cried the Tortoise, 'to open my mouth? Not I! Come now,
convey me!'</p>

<p>'Thereupon the Geese took up the stick; the Tortoise held fast with his
mouth, and away they flew. The country people, observing this strange
sight, ran after.</p>

<p>'Ho! ho!' cried one, 'look at the flying Tortoise!'</p>

<p>'When he falls we'll cook and eat him here,' said another.</p>

<p>'No; let us take him home for dinner!' cried a third.</p>

<p>'We can light a fire by the pool, and eat him,' said the first.</p>

<p>'The Tortoise heard these unkind remarks in a towering passion. 'Eat
me!&mdash;eat ashes!' he exclaimed, opening his mouth&mdash;and down he fell
directly, and was caught by the countrymen.&mdash;Said I not well,' concluded
the Goose-Minister, 'that to scorn counsel is to seek destruction?'</p>

<p>'You have well said,' replied King Silver-sides, disconsolately.</p>

<p>'Yes, your Majesty,' interposed the Crane, who was just returned, 'if
the Fort had been cleared, Night-cloud could not have fired it, as he
did, by the Vulture's instigation.'</p>

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Recluse_and_the_Mouse'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Recluse and the Mouse</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In the forest of the Sage Gautama there dwelt a Recluse named
Mighty-at-Prayer. Once, as he sat at his frugal meal, a young mouse
dropped beside him from the beak of a crow, and he took it up and fed it
tenderly with rice grains. Some time after the Saint observed a cat
pursuing his dependent to devour it, whereupon he changed the mouse into
a stout cat. The cat was a great deal harassed by dogs, upon which the
Saint again transformed it into a dog. The dog was always in danger of
the tigers, and his protector at last gave him the form of a
tiger&mdash;considering him all this while, and treating him withal, like
nothing but a mouse. The country-folk passing by would say, 'That a
tiger! not he; it is a mouse the Saint has transformed.' And the mouse
being vexed at this, reflected, 'So long as the Master lives, this
shameful story of my origin will survive!' With this thought he was
about to take the Saint's life, when he, who knew his purpose, turned
the ungrateful beast by a word to his original shape. Besides, your
Majesty,&quot; continued the Vulture, &quot;it may not be so easy to take in
Camphor-island&mdash;</p>

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Crane_and_the_Crab'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Crane and the Crab</b></h4>

<p>&quot;There was an old Crane at a mere called Lily-water, in Malwa, who stood
one day in the shallows with a most dejected look and drooping bill. A
Crab observed him and called out, 'Friend Crane! have you given up
eating, that you stand there all day?' 'Nay, sir!' replied the old
Crane; 'I love my dish of fish, but I have heard the fishermen say that
they mean to capture every one that swims in this water; and as that
destroys my hope of subsistence, I am resigning myself to death.' All
this the fishes overheard. 'In this matter certainly,' they said, 'his
interest is ours; we ought to consult him; for it is written&mdash;</p>

there for safety?'</p>

<p>'Course of safety there is,' replied the Crane, 'to go elsewhere; and I
will carry you one by one to another pool, if you please.'</p>

<p>'Do so,' said the trembling fishes.</p>

<p>&quot;The Crane accordingly took one after another, and having eaten them
returned with the report that he had safely deposited each. Last of all,
the Crab requested to be taken; and the Crane, coveting his tender
flesh, took him up with great apparent respect. On arriving at the spot,
which was covered with fish-bones, the Crab perceived the fate reserved
for him; and turning round he fastened upon the Crane's throat and tore
it so that he perished.'</p>

<p>'Well, but,' said King Jewel-plume, 'we can make Night-cloud viceroy

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Brahman_and_the_Pans'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Brahman and the Pans</b></h4>

<p>&quot;There was a Brahman in the city of V&aacute;na, whose name was Deva Sarman. At
the equinoctial feast of the Dussera, he obtained for his duxina-gift a
dish of flour, which he took into a potter's shed; and there lay down in
the shade among the pots, staff in hand. As he thus reclined he began to
meditate, 'I can sell this meal for ten cowrie-shells, and with them I
can purchase some of these pots and sell them at an advance. With all
that money I shall invest in betel-nuts and body-cloths and make a new
profit by their sale; and so go on trafficking till I get a lakh of
rupees&mdash;what's to prevent me? Then I shall marry four wives&mdash;and one at
least will be beautiful and young, and she shall be my favorite. Of
course the others will be jealous; but if they quarrel, and talk, and
trouble me I will belabor them like this&mdash;and this'&mdash;and therewith he
flourished his staff to such a purpose as to smash his meal-dish and
break several of the potter's jars. The potter, rushing out, took him by
the throat, and turned him off; and so ended his speculations. I smiled,
my Liege,' concluded the Vulture, 'at your precipitancy, thinking of
that story.'</p>

<p>'Tell me, then, my Father, what should be done,' said the King.</p>

<a name='The_Duel_of_the_Giants'></a><h4><b>The Duel of the Giants</b></h4>

<p>&quot;Long ago, my Liege, there were two Daityas named Sunda and Upasunda,
the which with penance and fasting worshipped that God who wears the
moon for his forehead-jewel; desiring to win his favor, and thereby the
lordship of the Three Worlds. At last the God, propitiated by their
devotion, spake thus unto them:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I grant a boon unto ye&mdash;choose what it shall be.'</p>

<p>'And they, who would have asked dominion, were suddenly minded of
Saraswati&mdash;who reigns over the hearts and thoughts of men&mdash;to seek a
forbidden thing.</p>

<p>'If,' said they, 'we have found favor, let the Divinity give us his own
cherished Parvati, the Queen of Heaven!'</p>

<p>'Terribly incensed was the God, but his word had passed, and the boon
must be granted; and Parvati the Divine was delivered up to them. Then
those two world-breakers, sick at heart, sin-blinded, and afire with the
glorious beauty of the Queen of Life&mdash;began to dispute, saying one to
another: 'Mine is she! mine is she!' At the last they called for an
umpire, and the God himself appeared before them as a venerable Brahman.</p>

<p>'Master,' said they, 'tell us whose she is, for we both won her by our
might.'</p>

<p>'Then spake that Brahman:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Brahmans for their lore have honor; Kshattriyas for their bravery;</span><br />

<p>'Thereupon they agreed that he spoke wisely, and drew and battled; and
being of equal force, they fell at the same moment by an exchange of
blows. Good my Lord,' concluded the Minister, 'peace is a better thing
than war,'</p>

<p>'But why not say so before?' asked Jewel-plume.</p>

<p>'I said it at the first,' replied the Minister. 'I knew King

to raise an insurrection in Jambudwipa.'</p>

<p>'It is well-conceived,' said the King. And forthwith a Crane, named
Pied-body, was dismissed with a secret message to that Rajah.</p>

<p>'In course of time the first Crane, who had been sent as a spy, came
back, and made his report. He related that the Vulture had advised his
Sovereign to summon Night-cloud, the Crow, and learn from him regarding
King Silver-sides' intentions. Night-cloud attended accordingly.</p>

<p>'Crow!' asked King Jewel-plume, 'what sort of a Monarch is the Rajah
Silver-sides?'</p>

<p>'Truthful, may it please you,' replied the Crow; 'and therewithal noble
as Yudisthira himself.'</p>

<p>'And his Minister, the Goose?'</p>

<p>'Is a Minister unrivalled, my Liege,' said the Crow-king.</p>

<p>'But how then didst thou so easily deceive them?'</p>

<p>'Ah! your Majesty,' said the Crow, 'there was little credit in that. Is
it not said?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Cheating them that truly trust you, 'tis a clumsy villainy!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Any knave may slay the child who climbs and slumbers on his knee.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Besides, the Minister detected me immediately. It was the King whose
innate goodness forbade him to suspect evil in another:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Believe a knave, thyself scorning a lie,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And rue it, like the Brahman, by and by.'</span><br />

<p>'What Brahman was that?' asked the King. Night-cloud replied:&mdash;</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Brahman_and_the_Goat'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Brahman and the Goat</b></h4>

<p>&quot;A Brahman that lived in the forest of Gautama, your Majesty. He had
purveyed a goat to make pooja, and was returning home with it on life
shoulder when he was descried by three knaves. 'If we could but obtain
that goat,' said they, 'it would be a rare trick'; and they ran on, and
seated themselves at the foot of three different trees upon the
Brahman's road. Presently he came up with the first of them, who
addressed him thus: 'Master! why do you carry that dog on your
shoulder?' 'Dog!' said the Brahman, 'it is a goat for sacrifice!' With
that he went on a coss, and came to the second knave; who called
out&mdash;'What doest thou with that dog, Master?' The Brahman laid his goat
upon the ground, looked it all over, took it up again upon his back, and
walked on with his mind in a whirl; for&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'The good think evil slowly, and they pay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A price for faith&mdash;as witness &quot;Crop-ear&quot; may.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'Who was Crop-ear?' asked the King of the Peacocks.</p>
<br />

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Camel_the_Lion_and_His_Court'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Camel, the Lion, and His Court</b></h4>

<p>&quot;A Camel, may it please you,&quot; replied Night-cloud, &quot;who strayed away
from a kafila, and wandered into the forest. A Lion, named
'Fierce-fangs,' lived in that forest; and his three courtiers, a Tiger,
a Jackal, and a Crow, met the Camel, and conducted him to their King.
His account of himself was satisfactory, and the Lion took him into his
service under the name of Crop-ear. Now it happened that the rainy
season was very severe, and the Lion became indisposed, so that there
was much difficulty in obtaining food for the Court. The courtiers
resolved accordingly to prevail on the Lion to kill the Camel; 'for what
interest have we,' they said, 'in this browser of thistles?'</p>

<p>'What, indeed!' observed the Tiger; 'but will the Rajah kill him after
his promise of protection, think you?'</p>

<p>'Being famished he will,' said the Crow. 'Know you not?&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Hunger hears not, cares not, spares not; no boon of the starving beg;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When the snake is pinched with craving, verily she eats her egg.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Accordingly they repaired to the Lion.</p>

<p>'Hast brought me food, fellow?' growled the Rajah.</p>

<p>'None, may it please you,' said the Crow.</p>

<p>'Must we starve, then?' asked his Majesty.</p>

<p>'Not unless you reject the food before you, Sire,' rejoined the Crow.</p>

<p>'Before me! how mean you?'</p>

<p>'I mean,' replied the Crow (and he whispered it in the Lion's ear),
'Crop-ear, the Camel!'</p>

<p>'Now!' said the Lion, and he touched the ground, and afterwards both
ears, as he spoke, 'I have given him my pledge for his safety, and how
should I slay him?'</p>

<p>'Nay, Sire! I said not slay,' replied the Crow; 'it may be that he will
offer himself for food. To that your Majesty would not object?'</p>

<p>'I am parlous hungry,' muttered the Lion.</p>

<p>'Then the Crow went to find the Camel, and, bringing all together before
the King under some pretence or other, he thus addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Sire! our pains are come to nothing: we can get no food, and we behold
our Lord falling away,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Of the Tree of State the root</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kings are&mdash;feed what brings the fruit.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>Take me, therefore, your Majesty, and break your fast upon me.&quot;</p>

<p>'Good Crow,' said the Lion, 'I had liefer die than do so.'</p>

<p>'Will your Majesty deign to make a repast upon me?' asked the Jackal.</p>

<p>'On no account!' replied the Lion.</p>

<p>'Condescend, my Lord,' said the Tiger, 'to appease your hunger with my
poor flesh.'</p>

<p>'Impossible!' responded the Lion.</p>

<p>'Thereupon Crop-ear, not to be behind in what seemed safe, made offer of
his own carcase, which was accepted before he had finished; the Tiger
instantly tearing his flank open, and all the rest at once devouring
him.</p>

<p>'The Brahman,' continued Night-cloud, 'suspected nothing more than did
the Camel; and when the third knave had broken his jest upon him for
bearing a dog, he threw it down, washed himself clean of the
contamination, and went home; while the knaves secured and cooked his
goat.'</p>

<p>'But, Night-cloud,' asked the Rajah, 'how couldst thou abide so long
among enemies, and conciliate them?'</p>

<p>'It is easy to play the courtier for a purpose,' said Night-cloud&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Courtesy may cover malice; on their heads the woodmen bring,</span><br />

<p>'How was that?' asked the Peacock-King. The Crow related:&mdash;</p>

<a name='The_Story_of_the_Frogs_and_the_Old_Serpent'></a><h4><b>The Story of the Frogs and the Old Serpent</b></h4>

<p>&quot;In a deserted garden there once lived a Serpent, 'Slow-coil' by name;
who had reached an age when he was no longer able to obtain his own
food. Lying listlessly by the edge of a pond, he was descried by a
certain Frog, and interrogated&mdash;</p>

<p>'Have you given up caring for food, Serpent?'</p>

<p>'Leave me, kindly Sir,' replied the subtle reptile; 'the griefs of a
miserable wretch like me cannot interest your lofty mind.'</p>

<p>'Let me at least hear them,' said the Frog, somewhat flattered.</p>

<p>'You must know, then, gracious Sir,' began the Serpent, 'that it is now
twenty years since here, in Brahmapoora, I bit the son of Kaundinya, a
holy Brahman; of which cruel bite he died. Seeing his boy dead,
Kaundinya abandoned himself to despair, and grovelled in his distress
upon the ground. Thereat came all his kinsmen, citizens of Brahmapoora,
and sat down with him, as the manner is&mdash;</p>

should be a carrier of frogs, and so retired&mdash;and here remain I to do
according to the Brahman's malediction.'</p>

<p>'The Frog, hearing all this, went and reported it to Web-foot the
Frog-King, who shortly came himself for an excursion on the Serpent. He
was carried delightfully, and constantly employed the conveyance. But
one day observing the Serpent to be sluggish, he asked the reason.</p>

<p>'May it please you,' explained the Serpent, 'your slave has nothing to
eat.'</p>

<p>'Eat a few of my frogs,' said the King. 'I give you leave.'</p>

<p>'I thank your Majesty!' answered the Serpent, and forthwith he began to
eat the frogs, until the pond becoming clear, he finished with their
monarch himself. 'I also,' said Night-cloud, 'stooped to conquer, but
King Silver-sides is a good King, and I would your Majesty were at peace
with him.'</p>

<p>'Peace!' cried King Jewel-plume, 'shall I make peace with my vassal! I
have vanquished him&mdash;let him serve me!'</p>

<p>&quot;At this moment the Parrot came in. 'Sire!' said he, breathlessly,' the
Stork Strong-bill, Rajah of Ceylon, has raised the standard of revolt in
Jambudwipa, and claims the country.'</p>

<p>'What! what!' cried the King in a fury.</p>

<p>'Excellent good, Goose!' muttered the Minister. 'This is thy work!'</p>

<p>'Bid him but await me!' exclaimed the King, 'and I will tear him up like
a tree!'</p>

<p>'Ah, Sire,' said the Minister&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Thunder for nothing, like December's cloud,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Passes unmarked: strike hard, but speak not loud.'</span><br />

<p>We cannot march without making peace first; our rear will be attacked.'</p>

<p>'Must it be so?' asked the King.</p>

<p>'My Liege, it must,' replied the Vulture.</p>

<p>'Make a peace then,' said the King, 'and make an end.'</p>

<p>'It is well,' observed the Minister, and set out for the Court of the
King Silver-sides. While he was yet coming, the Crane announced his
approach.</p>

<p>'Ah!' said the Swan-King, 'this will be another designing spy from the
enemy.'</p>

<p>'Misdoubt him not!' answered the Goose, smiling, 'it is the Vulture
Far-sight, a spirit beyond suspicion. Would your Majesty be as the Swan
that took the stars reflected in the pool for lily-buds, and being
deceived, would eat no lily-shoots by day, thinking them stars?'</p>

<p>'Not so! but treachery breeds mistrust,' replied the Rajah; is it not
written&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Minds deceived by evil natures, from the good their faith withhold;</span><br />

<p>'It is so written, my Liege,' said the Minister. 'But this one may be
trusted. Let him be received with compliments and a gift.'</p>

<p>'Accordingly the Vulture was conducted, with the most profound respect,
from the fort to the King's audience-hall, where a throne was placed for
him.</p>

<p>'Minister,' said the Goose, 'consider us and ours at thy disposal.'</p>

<p>'So consider us,' assented the Swan-King.</p>

<p>'I thank you,' said Far-sight; 'but&mdash;</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Proud men by obeisance greet;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Women's silly fancies soothe;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Give wise men their due&mdash;the truth.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>'I am come to conclude a peace, not to claim your kingdom. By what mode
shall we conclude it?'</p>

<p>'How many modes be there?' asked King Silver-sides.</p>

<p>'Sixteen,' replied the Vulture.</p>

<p>'Are the alliances numbered therein?' asked the King.</p>

<p>'No! these be four,' answered the Vulture, 'namely&mdash;of mutual help&mdash;of
friendship&mdash;of blood&mdash;and of sacrifice.'</p>

<p>'You are a great diplomatist!' said the King. 'Advise us which to
choose!'</p>

<p>'There is no Peace like the Golden &quot;Sangata,&quot; which is made between good
men, based on friendly feeling, and preceded by the Oath of Truth,'
replied the Vulture.</p>

<p>'Let us make that Peace!' said the Goose. Far-sight accordingly, with
fresh presents of robes and jewels, accompanied the Goose to the camp of
the Peacock-King. The Rajah, Jewel-plume, gave the Goose a gracious
audience, accepted his terms of Peace, and sent him back to the
Swan-King, loaded with gifts and kind speeches. The revolt in Jambudwipa
was suppressed, and the Peacock-King retired to his own kingdom.</p>

<p>&quot;And now,&quot; said Vishnu-Sarman, &quot;I have told your Royal Highnesses all.
Is there anything remaining to be told?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Reverend Sir!&quot; replied the Princes, &quot;there is nothing. Thanks to you,
we have heard and comprehended the perfect cycle of kingly duty, and are
content.&quot;</p>

<a name='NALA_AND_DAMAYANTI_a'></a><h2>NALA AND DAMAYANTI</h2>

<h4>[<i>Selected from the &quot;Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata&quot; Translation by Sir Edwin Arnold</i>]</h4>
<br />

<a name='ND_INTRODUCTION'></a><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<br />

<p>The &quot;Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata&quot; is the oldest epic in Sanscrit literature, and is
sevenfold greater in bulk than the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; taken together.
This remarkable poem contains almost all the history of ancient India,
so far as it can be recovered, together with inexhaustible details of
its political, social, and religious life&mdash;in fact, the antique Hindoo
world stands epitomized in it. The Old Testament is not more interwoven
with the Jewish race, nor the New Testament with the civilization of
Christendom, nor even the Koran with the records and destinies of Islam,
than is this great Sanscrit poem with the unchanging and teeming
population of Hindostan. The stories, songs, and ballads, the
genealogies, the nursery tales and religious discourses, the art, the
learning, the philosophy, the creeds, the modes of thought, the very
phrases and daily ideas of the Hindoo people are taken from this poem.
Their children are named after its heroes; so are their cities, streets,
and even cattle. It is the spiritual life of the Hindoo people. It is
personified, worshipped, and cited as being something divine. To read,
or even to listen, is to the devout Hindoo sufficiently meritorious to
bring prosperity to the fireside in this world, and happiness in the
world to come.</p>

<p>The western world has as yet only received the &quot;Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata&quot; in
fragments&mdash;mere specimens, bearing to those vast treasures of Sanscrit
literature such small proportion as cabinet samples of ore have to the
riches of a mine. Such knowledge as we have of the great Indian epics is
largely due to Sir William Jones, and the host of translators who
followed him.</p>

<p>In its present shape the &quot;Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata&quot; contains some two hundred
thousand verses. The style is forcible, often terse and nervous: the
action is well sustained, and the whole effect produced is that of a
poem written in commemoration of actual conflict between members of
rival clans who lived somewhere southeast of the Punjab. In portrayal of
character the Hindoo poem somewhat resembles its Grecian
counterpart&mdash;the &quot;Iliad&quot;; the noble devotion and chivalric character of
its chief hero, Arjuna, reminds us of Hector&mdash;and the wily, sinful
Duryodhana, is a second Ulysses. The &quot;Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata&quot; was probably begun in
the third or fourth century B.C., and completed soon after the beginning
of the Christian era.</p>

<p>The &quot;Bh&acirc;rata&quot; war is a war between rival cousins of the house of
Bh&acirc;rata, a race of heroes mentioned in the Rig-veda collection.
Duryodhana deprives his cousin Yudhisthira of his throne by inducing him
to squander his fortune, kingdom, family, and self&mdash;and then banishes
Yudhisthira and the latter's four brothers for twelve years. The
gambling was conducted in an unfair manner, and the cousins feel that
their banishment was the result of treachery, although pretended to be
mercy in lieu of death. When the twelve years are over they collect
armies of sympathizers, and on the Sacred Plain of the Kurus (the Holy
Land of India) the great war is fought out. The good prevails,
Duryodhana is slain, and Yudhisthira recovers his kingdom. This story is
told so graphically that the &quot;Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata&quot; still has the charm that
comes from plot and action, as well as that of poetic beauty.</p>

<p>A concluding passage of this great poem says: &quot;The reading of this
'Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata' destroys all sin and produces virtue, so much so that the
pronunciation of a single shloka is sufficient to wipe away much guilt.
It has bound human beings in a chain, of which one end is life and the
other death. If a man reads the 'Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata' and has faith in its
doctrines, he is free from all sin and ascends to heaven after his
death.&quot;</p>

<p>The present selection is the episode of Nala and Damayanti. It is one of
the most charming of the &quot;Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata&quot; stories, and its Oriental flavor
and delicacy have been well preserved by the translator, Sir Edwin
Arnold.</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A prince there was, named Nala, Virasen's noble breed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Goodly to see, and virtuous; a tamer of the steed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As Indra 'midst the gods, so he of kings was kingliest one,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sovereign of men, and splendid as the golden, glittering sun;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pure, knowing scripture, gallant; ruling nobly Nishadh's lands;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dice-loving, but a proud, true chief of her embattled bands;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By lovely ladies lauded; free, trained in self-control;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A shield and bow; a Manu on earth; a royal soul!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And in Vidarbha's city the Raja Bhima dwelled;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Save offspring, from his perfect bliss no blessing was withheld;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For offspring, many a pious rite full patiently he wrought,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till Damana the Brahman unto his house was brought.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Him Bhima, ever reverent, did courteously entreat,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Within the Queen's pavilion led him, to rest and eat;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whereby that sage, grown grateful, gave her&mdash;for joy of joys&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A girl, the gem of girlhood, and three brave lusty boys&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Damana, Dama, D&acirc;nta, their names:&mdash;Damayanti she;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No daughter more delightful, no sons could goodlier be.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stately and bright and beautiful did Damayanti grow;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No land there was which did not the Slender-waisted know;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A hundred slaves her fair form decked with robe and ornament&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like &#346;achi's self to serve her a hundred virgins bent;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And 'midst them Bhima's daughter, in peerless glory dight,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gleamed as the lightning glitters against the murk of night;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Having the eyes of Lakshmi, long-lidded, black, and bright&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nay&mdash;never Gods, nor Yakshas, nor mortal men among</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was one so rare and radiant e'er seen, or sued, or sung</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As she, the heart-consuming, in heaven itself desired.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Nala, too, of princes the Tiger-Prince, admired</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like Kama was; in beauty an embodied lord of love:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And ofttimes Nala praised they all other chiefs above</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In Damayanti's hearing; and oftentimes to him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With worship and with wonder, her beauty they would limn;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So that, unmet, unknowing, unseen, in each for each</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A tender thought of longing grew up from seed of speech;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And love (thou son of Kunti!) those gentle hearts did reach.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thus Nala&mdash;hardly bearing in his heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such longing&mdash;wandered in his palace-woods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And marked some water-birds, with painted plumes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Disporting. One, by stealthy steps, he seized;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But the sky-traveller spake to Nala this:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Kill me not, Prince, and I will serve thee well.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For I, in Damayanti's ear, will say</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such good of Nishadh's lord, that nevermore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall thought of man possess her, save of thee.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thereat the Prince gladly gave liberty</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To his soft prisoner, and all the swans</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Flew, clanging, to Vidarbha&mdash;a bright flock&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Straight to Vidarbha, where the Princess walked;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And there, beneath her eyes, those winged ones</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lighted. She saw them sail to earth, and marked&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sitting amid her maids&mdash;their graceful forms;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While those for wantonness 'gan chase the swans,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which fluttered this and that way through the grove:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each girl with tripping feet her bird pursued,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Damayanti, laughing, followed hers;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till&mdash;at the point to grasp&mdash;the flying prey</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deftly eluding touch, spake as men speak,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Addressing Bhima's daughter:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 17em;'>&quot;Lady dear!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Loveliest Damayanti! Nala dwells</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In near Nishadha: oh, a noble Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Not to be matched of men; an A&#347;win he,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For goodliness. Incomparable maid!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wert thou but wife to that surpassing chief,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rich would the fruit grow from such lordly birth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such peerless beauty. Slender-waisted one,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gods, men, and Gandharvas have we beheld,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But never none among them like to him.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As thou art pearl of princesses, so he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is crown of princes; happy would it fall,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One such perfection should another wed.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And when she heard that bird (O King of men!)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess answered: &quot;Go, dear swan, and tell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This same to Nala;&quot; and the egg-born said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;I go&quot;&mdash;and flew; and told the Prince of all.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But Damayanti, having heard the bird,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lived fancy-free no more; by Nala's side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her soul dwelt, while she sat at home distraught,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mournful and wan, sighing the hours away,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With eyes upcast, and passion-laden looks;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So that, eftsoons, her limbs failed, and her mind&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With love o'erweighted&mdash;found no rest in sleep,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No grace in company, no joy at feasts.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor night nor day brought peace; always she heaved</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sigh upon sigh, till all her maidens knew&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By glance and mien and moan&mdash;how changed she was,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her own sweet self no more. Then to the King</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They told how Damayanti loved the Prince.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which thing when Bhima from her maidens heard,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deep pondering for his child what should be done,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And why the Princess was beside herself,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That lord of lands perceived his daughter grown,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And knew that for her high Swayamvara</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The time was come.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 11.5em;'>So, to the Rajas all</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The King sent word: &quot;Ye Lords of Earth, attend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Damayanti the Swayamvara.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when these learned of her Swayamvara,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Obeying Bhima, to his court they thronged&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Elephants, horses, cars&mdash;over the land</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In full files wending, bearing flags and wreaths</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of countless hues, with gallant companies</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of fighting men. And those high-hearted chiefs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The strong-armed King welcomed with worship fair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As fitted each, and led them to their seats.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Now at that hour there passed towards Indra's heaven,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thither from earth ascending, those twain saints&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wise, the pure, the mighty-minded ones,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The self-restrained&mdash;Narad and Parvata.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mansion of the Sovereign of the Gods</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In honor entered they; and he, the Lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Clouds, dread Indra, softly them salutes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Inquiring of their weal, and of the world</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wherethrough their name was famous, how it fares.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then Narad said: &quot;Well is it, Lord of Gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With us, and with our world; and well with those</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who rule the peoples, O thou King in Heaven!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But He that slew the Demons spake again:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The princes of the earth, just-minded, brave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those who, in battle fearing not to fall,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>See death on the descending blade, and charge</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Full front against it, turning not their face&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Theirs is this realm eternal, as to me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The cow of plenty, K&acirc;madhuk, belongs.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where be my Kshatriya warriors? Wherefore now</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>See I none coming of those slaughtered lords,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Chiefs of mankind, our always honored guests?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And unto Indra Narad gave reply:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;King of the Air! no wars are waged below;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>None fall in fight, to enter here. The Lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of high Vidarbha hath a daughter, famed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For loveliness beyond all earthly maids,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess Damayanti, far-renowned.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of her, dread Sakra! the Swayamvara</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall soon befall, and thither now repair</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The kings and princes of all lands, to woo&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each for himself&mdash;this pearl of womanhood.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For oh, thou Slayer of the Demons, all</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Desire the maid.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 10.5em;'>Drew round, while Narad spake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Masters, th'Immortals, pressing in</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With Agni and the Greatest, near the throne,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To listen to the speech of Narada;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom having heard, all cried delightedly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;We, too, will go.&quot; Thereupon those high gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With chariots, and with heavenly retinues,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sped to Vidarbha, where the kings were met.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Nala, knowing of this kingly tryst,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Went thither joyous, heart-full with the thought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Damayanti.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 9em;'>Thus it chanced the gods</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beheld the Prince wending along his road,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Goodly of mien, as is the Lord of Love.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The world's Protectors saw him, like a sun</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For splendor; and, in very wonder, paused</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Some time irresolute, so fair he was;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then in mid-sky their golden chariots stayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And through the clouds descending called to him:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Abo! Nala of Nishadha! Noblest Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be herald for us; bear our message now.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Yea!&quot; Nala made reply, &quot;this will I do&quot;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And then&mdash;palm unto palm in reverence pressed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Asked: &quot;Shining Ones, who are ye? Unto whom,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And what words bearing, will ye that I go?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deign to instruct me what it is ye bid.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus the Prince spake, and Indra answered him:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Thou seest th'immortal gods. Indra am I,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And this is Agni, and the other here,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Varuna, Lord of Waters; and beyond,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yama, the King of Death, who parteth souls</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From mortal frames. To Damayanti go;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tell our approach. Say this: 'The world's dread lords,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wishful to see thee, come; desiring thee&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Indra, Varuna, Agni, Yama, all.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Choose of these powers to which thou wilt be given.'&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But Nala, hearing that, joined palms again,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And cried: &quot;Ah, send me not, with one accord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For this, most mighty Gods! How should a man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sue for another, being suitor too?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How bear such errand? Have compassion, Gods!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then spake they: &quot;Yet thou saidst, 'This shall I do,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha's Prince! and wilt thou do it not,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forswearing faith? Nay, but depart, and soon!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So bid, but lingering yet again, he said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Well guarded are the gates; how shall I find</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Speech with her?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 11em;'>&quot;Thou shalt find,&quot; Indra replied.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, lo! upon that word Nala was brought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Damayanti's chamber. There he saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vidarbha's glory, sitting 'mid her maids,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In majesty and grace surpassing all;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So exquisite, so delicate of form,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Waist so fine-turned, such limbs, such lighted eyes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The moon hath meaner radiance than she.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Love at the sight of that soft smiling face</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sprang to full passion, while he stood and gazed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet, faith and duty urging, he restrained</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His beating heart; but when those beauteous maids</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spied Nala, from their cushions they uprose,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Startled to see a man, yet startled more</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Because he showed so heavenly bright and fair.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In wondering pleasure each saluted him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Uttering no sound, but murmuring to themselves:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Aho! the grace of him: aho! the brilliance;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Aho! what glorious strength lives in his limbs!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What is he? Is he God, Gandharva, Yaksha?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But this unspoken, for they dared not breathe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One syllable, all standing shyly there</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To see him, and to see his youth so sweet.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet, softly glancing back to his soft glance,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess, presently, with fluttering breath,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Accosted Nala, saying: &quot;Fairest Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who by thy faultless form hath filled my heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With sudden joy, coming as come the gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unstayed, I crave to know thee, who thou art;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How didst thou enter? how wert thou unseen?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our palace is close-guarded, and the King</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hath issued mandates stern.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 16em;'>Tenderly spake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Prince, replying to those tender words:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Most lovely! I am Nala. I am come</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A herald of the gods unto thee here.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gods desire thee, the immortal Four&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Indra, Varuna, Yama, Agni. Choose,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O Brightest! one from these to be thy lord.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By their help is it I have entered in</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unseen; none could behold me at thy gates,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor stay me, passing; and to speak their will</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They sent me, fairest one and best. Do thou,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Knowing the message, judge as seemeth well.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>She bowed her head, hearing the great gods named,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And then, divinely smiling, said to him:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Pledge thyself faithfully to me, and I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Will seek, O Raja, only how to pay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That debt with all I am, with all I have;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For I and mine are thine&mdash;in full trust thine.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Make me that promise, Prince. Thy gentle name&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sung by the swan&mdash;first set my thoughts afire;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And for thy sake&mdash;only for thee&mdash;sweet Lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The kings were summoned hither. If, alas!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fair Prince, thou dost reject my sudden love,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So proffered, then must poison, flame, or flood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or knitted cord, be my sad remedy.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So spake Vidarbha's Pride; and Nala said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;With gods so waiting&mdash;with the world's dread lords</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hastening to woo, canst thou desire a man?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bethink! I, unto these, that make and mar,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These all-wise ones, almighty, am like dust</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Under their feet: lift thy heart to the height</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of what I bring. If mortal man offend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The most high gods, death is what springs of it.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spare me to live, thou faultless lady! Choose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which of these excellent great gods thou wilt;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wear the unstained robes! bear on thy brows</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wreaths which never fade, of heavenly blooms!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be, as thou mayest, a goddess, and enjoy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Godlike delights! Him who enfolds the earth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Creating and consuming, Brightest Power,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hut&acirc;sa, Eater of the Sacrifice,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What woman would not take? Or him whose rod</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Herds all the generations forward still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On virtue's path, Red Yama, King of Death,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What woman would affront? Or him, the all-good,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All-wise destroyer of the Demons, first</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In heaven, Mahendra&mdash;who of womankind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is there that would not wed? Or, if thy mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Incline, doubt not to choose Varuna; he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is of these world-protectors. From a heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Full friendly cometh what I tell thee now.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Unto Nishadha's Prince the maid replied&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tears of distress dimming her lustrous eyes&mdash;-</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Humbly I reverence these mighty gods;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But thee I choose, and thee I take for lord;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And this I vow!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 10.5em;'>With folded palms she stood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And trembling lips, while his faint answer fell:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Sent on such embassy, how shall I dare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Speak, sweetest Princess, for myself to thee?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bound by my promise for the gods to sue,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How can I be a suitor for myself?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Silence is here my duty; afterwards,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If I shall come, in mine own name I'll come,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mine own cause pleading. Ah, might that so be!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Checking her tears, Damayanti sadly smiled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And said full soft: &quot;One way of hope I see,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A blameless way, O Lord of men! wherefrom</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No fault shall rise, nor any danger fall.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou also, Prince, with Indra and these gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Must enter in where my Swayamvara</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is held; then I, in presence of those gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Will choose thee, dearest, for my lord; and so</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Blame shall not light on thee,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 18em;'>With which sweet words</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soft in his ears, Nishadha straight returned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There where the gods were gathered, waiting him;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom the world's masters, on his way, perceived,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, spying, questioned, asking for his news:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Saw'st thou her, Prince? Didst see the sweet-lipped one?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What spake she of us? Tell us true; tell all!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Quoth Nala: &quot;By your worshipful behest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sent to her house, the great gates entered I,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though the gray porters watched; but none might spy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My entering, by your power, O radiant Ones,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saving the Raja's daughter; her I saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Amid her maidens, and by them was seen.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On me with much amazement they did gaze</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whilst I your high Divinities extolled.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But she that hath the lovely face, with mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Set upon me, hath chosen me, ye Gods.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For thus she spake, my Princess: 'Let them come,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And come thou, like a lordly tiger, too,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto the place of my Swayamvara;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There will I choose thee in their presence, Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To be my lord; and so there will not fall</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Blame, thou strong-armed! to thee,' This she did say</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even as I tell it; and what shall be next,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To will is yours, O ye immortal Ones!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Soon, when the moon was good, and day and hour</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were found propitious, Bhima, King of men,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Summoned the chiefs to the Swayamvara;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon which message all those eager lords</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For love of Damayanti hastened there.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Glorious with gilded pillars was the court,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whereto a gate-house opened, and thereby</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into the square, like lions from the hills,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Paced the proud guests; and there their seats they took,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each in his rank, the masters of the lands,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With crowns of fragrant blossoms garlanded,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And polished jewels swinging in their ears.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of some the thews, knitted and rough, stood forth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like iron maces; some had slender limbs,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sleek and fine-turned like the five-headed snake;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lords with long-flowing hair; glittering lords;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High-nosed, and eagle-eyed, and heavy-browed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The faces of those kings shone in a ring</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As shine at night the stars; and that great square</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As thronged with Rajas was as Naga-land</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is full of serpents; thick with warlike chiefs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As mountain-caves with panthers. Unto these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Entered, in matchless majesty of form,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess Damayanti. As she came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The glory of her ravished eyes and hearts,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So that the gaze of all those haughty kings,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fastening upon her loveliness, grew fixed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Not moving save with her&mdash;step after step</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Onward and always following the maid.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But while the styles and dignities of all</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were cried aloud (O son of Bh&acirc;rat!), lo!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess marked five of that throng alike</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In form and garb and visage. There they stood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each from the next undifferenced, but each</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala's own self;&mdash;yet which might Nala be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In nowise could that doubting maid descry.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who took her eye seemed Nala while she gazed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Until she looked upon his like; and so</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pondered the lovely lady, sore-perplexed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thinking, &quot;How shall I tell which be the gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And which is noble Nala?&quot; Deep-distressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And meditative waxed she, musing hard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What those signs were, delivered us of old,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whereby gods may be known: &quot;Of all those signs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Taught by our elders, lo! I see not one</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where stand yon five.&quot; So murmured she, and turned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Over and over every mark she knew.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At last, resolved to make the gods themselves</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her help at need, with reverent air and voice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Humbly saluted she those heavenly ones,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with joined palms and trembling accents spake:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;As, when I heard the swans, I chose my Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By that sincerity I call ye, Gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To show my Love to me and make me know!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As in my heart and soul and speech I stand</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>True to my choice, by that sincerity</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I call the all-knowing gods to make me know!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As the high gods created Nishadha's chief</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To be my lord, by their sincerity</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I bid them show themselves, and make me know!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As my vow, sealed to him, must be maintained</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For his name, and for mine, I call the gods</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By such sincerity to make me know!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let them appear, the masters of the world&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The high gods&mdash;each one in his proper shape,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That I may see Nishadha's chief, my choice,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom minstrels praise, and Damayanti loves.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Hearing that earnest speech&mdash;so passion-fraught,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So full of truth, of strong resolve, of love,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of singleness of soul and constancy&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even as she spake, the gods disclosed themselves.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By well-seen signs the effulgent Ones she knew.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shadowless stood they, with unwinking eyes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And skins which never moist with sweat; their feet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Light-gliding o'er the ground, not touching it;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The unfading blossoms on their brows not soiled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By earthly dust, but ever fair and fresh.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whilst, by their side, garbed so and visaged so,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But doubled by his shadow, stained with dust,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The flower-cups wiltering in his wreath, his skin</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pearly with sweat, his feet upon the earth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And eyes a-wink, stood Nala. One by one</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Glanced she on those divinities, then bent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her gaze upon the Prince, and, joyous, said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;I know thee, and I name my rightful lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Taking Nishadha's chief.&quot; Therewith she drew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Modestly nigh, and held him by the cloth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With large eyes beaming love, and round his neck</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hung the bright chaplet, love's delicious crown;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So choosing him&mdash;him only&mdash;whom she named</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before the face of all to be her lord.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Oh, then brake forth from all those suitors proud,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Ha!&quot; and &quot;Aho!&quot; But from the gods and saints,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Sadhu! well done! well done!&quot; And all admired</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The happy Prince, praising the grace of him;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While Virasena's son, delightedly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spake to the slender-waisted these fond words:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Fair Princess! since, before all gods and men,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou makest me thy choice, right glad am I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of this thy mind, and true lord will I be.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For so long, loveliest, as my breath endures,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thine am I! Thus I plight my troth to thee.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So, with joined palms, unto that beauteous maid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His gentle faith he pledged, rejoicing her;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, hand in hand, radiant with mutual love,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before great Agni and the gods they passed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The world's protectors worshipping.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 19.5em;'>Then those,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The lords of life, the powerful Ones, bestowed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Being well-pleased&mdash;on Nala, chosen so,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Eight noble boons. The boon which Indra gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was grace, at times of sacrifice, to see</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The visible god approach, with step divine;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Agni's boon was this, that he would come</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whenever Nala called&mdash;for everywhere</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hut&acirc;sa shineth, and all worlds are his;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yama gave skill in cookery, steadfastness</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In virtue; and Varuna, King of Floods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bade all the waters ripple at his call.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These boons the high gods doubled by the gift</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of bright wreaths wove with magic blooms of heaven;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And those bestowed, ascended to their seats.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Also with wonder and with joy returned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Rajas and the Maharajas all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Full of the marriage-feast; for Bhima made,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In pride and pleasure, stately nuptials;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So Damayanti and the Prince were wed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then, having tarried as is wont, that lord&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha's chief&mdash;took the King's leave, and went</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto his city, bringing home with him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His jewel of all womanhood, with whom</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Blissful he lived, as lives by &#346;achi's side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The slayer of the Demons. Like a sun</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shone Nala on his throne, ruling his folk</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In strength and virtue, guardian of his state.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Also the A&#347;wamedha Rite he made</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Greatest of rites, the Offering of the Horse,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As did Yay&acirc;ti; and all other acts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of worship; and to sages gave rich gifts.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Many dear days of much delicious love,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In pleasant gardens and in shadowy groves,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Passed they together, sojourning like gods.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Damayanti bore unto her lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A boy named Indrasen, and next, a girl</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Named Indrasena. So in happiness</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The good Prince governed, seeing all his lands</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wealthy and well, in piety and peace.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Now at the choosing of Nishadha's chief</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Bhima's daughter, when those lords of life&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The effulgent gods&mdash;departed, Dwapara</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They saw with Kali, coming. Indra said&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Demon-slayer&mdash;spying these approach:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Whither, with Dwapara, goest thou to-day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O Kali?&quot; And the sombre Shade replied:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;To Damayanti's high Swayamvara</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I go, to make her mine, since she hath passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into my heart.&quot; But Indra, laughing, said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Ended is that Swayamvara; for she</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hath taken Raja Nala for her lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before us all,&quot; But Kali, hearing this,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Breaks into wrath&mdash;while he stood worshipping</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That band divine&mdash;and furiously cries:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;If she hath set a man above the gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To wed with him, for such sin let there fall</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Doom, rightful, swift, and terrible, on her!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Nay,&quot; answered unto him those heavenly ones,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;But Damayanti chose with our good-will;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And what maid but would choose so fair a prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeing he hath all qualities, and knows</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Virtue, and rightly practises the vows,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And reads the four great Vedas, and, what's next,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Holy Stories, whilst, perpetually,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gods are honored in his house with gifts?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No hurt he does, kind to all living things;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>True of word is he, faithful, liberal, just;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Steadfast and patient, temperate and pure;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A king of men is Nala, like the gods.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He that would curse a prince of such a mould,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou foolish Kali, lays upon himself</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A sin to crush himself; the curse comes back</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sinks him in the bottomless vast gulf</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Narak.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 7em;'>Thus the gods to Kali spake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And mounted heavenward; whereupon that Shade,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Frowning, to Dwapara burst forth: &quot;My rage</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beareth no curb. Henceforth in Nala I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Will dwell; his kingdom I will make to fall;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His bliss with Damayanti I will mar;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thou within the dice shalt enter straight,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And help me, Dwapara! to drag him down,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Into which compact entering, those repaired&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kali and Dwapara&mdash;to Nala's house,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And haunted in Nishadha, where he ruled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeking occasion 'gainst the blameless Prince.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Long watched they; twelve years rolled ere Kali saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fateful fault arrive; Nishadha's Lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Easing himself, and sprinkling hands and lips</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With purifying water, passed to prayer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His feet unwashed, offending. Kali straight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Possessed the heedless Raja, entering him.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>That hour there sat with Nala, Pushkara</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His brother; and the evil spirit hissed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into the ear of Pushkara: &quot;Ehi!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Arise, and challenge Nala at the dice.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Throw with the Prince! it may be thou shalt win</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(Luck helping thee, and I) Nishadha's throne,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Town, treasures, palace&mdash;thou mayest gain them all.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Pushkara, hearing Kali's evil voice,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made near to Nala, with the dice in hand</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(A great piece for the &quot;Bull,&quot; and little ones</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For &quot;Cows,&quot; and Kali hiding in the Bull).</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So Pushkara came to Nala's side and said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Play with me, brother, at the 'Cows and Bull';&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, being put off, cried mockingly, &quot;Nay, play!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shaming the Prince, whose spirit chafed to leave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A gage unfaced; but when Vidarbha's gem,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess, heard that challenge, Nala rose:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Yea, Pushkara, I will play!&quot; fiercely he said;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And to the game addressed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 15em;'>His gems he lost,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Armlets and belt and necklet; next the gold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the palace and its vessels; then the cars</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yoked with swift steeds; and last, the royal robes:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For, cast by cast, the dice against him fell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bewitched by Kali; and, cast after cast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The passion of the dice kept hold on him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Until not one of all his faithfullest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Could stay the madman's hand and gamester's heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of who was named &quot;Subduer of his Foes.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The townsmen gathered with the ministers:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into that palace gate they thronged (my King!)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To see their lord, if so they might abate</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This sickness of his soul. The charioteer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forth standing from their midst, low worshipping,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spake thus to Damayanti: &quot;Great Princess,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before thy door all the grieved city sits.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Say to our lord for us, 'Thy folk are here;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They mourn that evil fortunes hold their liege,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who was so high and just,'&quot; Then she, deject,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Passed in, and to Nishadha's ruler said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her soft voice broken, and her bright eyes dimmed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Raja, the people of thy town are here;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before our gates they gather, citizens</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And counsellors, desiring speech with thee;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In lealty they come. Wilt thou be pleased</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We open to them? Wilt thou?&quot; So she asked</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Again and yet again; but not one word</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To that sad lady with the lovely brows</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Did Nala answer, wholly swallowed up</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Kali and the gaming; so that those&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The citizens and counsellors&mdash;cried out,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Our lord is changed! He is not Nala now!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And home returned, ashamed and sorrowful;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whilst ceaselessly endured that foolish play</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Moon after moon&mdash;the Prince the loser still.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then Damayanti, seeing so estranged</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her lord, the praised in song, the chief of men,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Watching, all self-possessed, his fantasy,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And how the gaming held him; sad, and 'feared,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The heavy fortunes pondering of her Prince;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hating the fault, but to the offender kind;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And fearing Nala should be stripped of all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This thing devised: Vrihatsen&acirc; she called&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her foster-nurse and faithful ministrant&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>True, skilful at all service, soft of speech,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kind-hearted; and she said, &quot;Vrihatsen&acirc;,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Go call the ministers to council now,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As though 'twere Nala bade; and make them count</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What store is gone of treasure, what abides.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So went Vrihatsen&acirc;, and summoned those;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when they knew all things, as from the Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Truly we, too, shall perish!&quot; cried they then;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all to Nala went, and all the town,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A second time assembling, thronged his gates:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which Bhima's daughter told; but not one word</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Answered the Prince. And when she saw her lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Put by her plea, utterly slighting it,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Back to her chamber, full of shame, she goes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And there still hears the dice are falling ill;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still hears of Nala daily losing more;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So that again unto her nurse she spake:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Send to Varshneya, good Vrihatsen&acirc;;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Say to the charioteer&mdash;in Nala's name&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'A great thing is to do. Come thou!'&quot; And this&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So soon as Damayanti uttered it&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vrihatsen&acirc;, by faithful servants, told</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto the son of Vrishni, who, being come</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In fitting time and place, heard the sweet Queen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In mournful music speak these wistful words:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Thou knowest how thy Raja trusted thee;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now he hath fall'n on evil; succor him!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The more that Pushkara conquers in the play,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wilder rage of gaming takes thy lord&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The more for Pushkara the dice light well,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>More contrary they happen to the Prince:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor heeds he, as were meet, kindred or friends;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nay, of myself he putteth by the prayer</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unanswered, being bewitched; for well I deem</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This is not noble-minded Nala's sin,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But some ill spell possesseth him to shut</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His ears to me. Thou, therefore, charioteer!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our refuge be; do what I shall command;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My heart is dark with fear. Yea, it may fall</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our lord will perish. Wherefore, harnessing</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His chosen steeds, which fly as swift as thought.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Take these our children in the chariot</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And drive to Kundina, delivering there</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto my kin the little ones, and car,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And horses. Afterwards abide thou there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or otherwhere depart.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 13.5em;'>Varshneya heard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The words of Damayanti, and forthwith</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In Nala's council-hall recounted them,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The chief men being present; who, thus met,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And long debating, gave him leave to go.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So with that royal pair to Bhima's town</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Drove he, and at Vidarbha rendered up,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Together with the swift steeds and the car,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That sweet maid Indrasena, and the Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Indrasen, and made reverence to the King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saddened for sake of Nala. Afterwards</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Taking his leave, unto Ayodhy&acirc;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Varshneya went, exceeding sorrowful,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with King Rituparna (O my Prince!)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Took service as a charioteer.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 17em;'>These gone&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The praised-of-poets, Nala, still played on,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till Pushkara his kingdom's wealth had won,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And whatso was to lose beside. Thereat</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With scornful laugh mocked he that beggared Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saying, &quot;One other throw; once more!&mdash;Yet sooth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What canst thou stake? Nothing is left for thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Save Damayanti; all the rest is mine.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Play we for Damayanti, if thou wilt.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But hearing this from Pushkara, the Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So in his heart by grief and shame was torn,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No word he uttered&mdash;only glared in wrath</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon his mocker, upon Pushkara.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, his rich robes and jewels stripping off,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Uncovered, with one cloth, 'mid waiting friends</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sorrowful passed he forth, his great state gone;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess, with one garment, following him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Piteous to see. And there without the gates</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Three nights they lay&mdash;Nashadha's King and Queen.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon the fourth day Pushkara proclaimed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Throughout the city, &quot;Whoso yieldeth help</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Nala, dieth! Let my will be known!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So, for this bitter word of Pushkara's power</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(O Yudhisthir!) the townsmen rendered not</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Service nor love, but left them outcast there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unhelped, whom all the city should have helped.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet three nights longer tarried he, his drink</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The common pool, his meat such fruits and roots</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As miserable hunger plucks from earth:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then fled they from those walls, the Prince going first,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess following.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 14em;'>After grievous days,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pinched ever with sharp famine, Nala saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A flock of gold-winged birds lighting anigh,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And to himself the famished Raja said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Lo! here is food; this day we shall have store;&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then lightly cast his cloth and covered them.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But these, fluttering aloft, bore with them there</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala's one cloth; and, hovering overhead,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Uttered sharp-stinging words, reviling him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even as he stood, naked to all the airs,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Downcast and desperate: &quot;Thou brain-sick Prince!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We are the dice; we come to ravish hence</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy last poor cloth; we were not well content</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou shouldst depart owning a garment still.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when he saw the dice take wings and fly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Leaving him bare, to Damayanti spake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This melancholy Prince: &quot;O Blameless One,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They by whose malice I am driven forth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Finding no sustenance, sad, famine-gaunt&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They whose decree forbade Nishadha's folk</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Should succor me, their Raja&mdash;these have come&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Demon and dice&mdash;and like to winged birds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Have borne away my cloth. To such shame fall'n,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such utmost woe, wretched, demented&mdash;I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy lord am still, and counsel thee for good.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Attend! Hence be there many roads which go</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Southwards: some pass Avanti's walls, and some</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Skirt Rikshavan, the forest of the bears;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This wends to Vindhya's lofty peaks, and this</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To the green banks where quick Payoshni runs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seaward, between her hermitages, rich</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In fruits and roots; and yon path leadeth thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto Vidarbha; that to Kosala,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And therefrom southward&mdash;southward&mdash;far away.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So spake he to the Princess wistfully,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Between his words pointing along the paths,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which she should take (O King!). But Bhima's child</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made answer, bowed with grief, her soft voice choked</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With sobs, these piteous accents uttering:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;My heart beats quick; my body's force is gone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thinking, dear Prince, on this which thou hast said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pointing along the paths. What! robbed of realm,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stripped of thy wealth, bare, famished, parched with thirst,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus shall I leave thee in the untrodden wood?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, no! While thou dost muse on dear days fled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hungry and weeping, I in this wild waste</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Will charm thy griefs away, solacing thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wisest doctors say, 'In every woe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No better physic is than wifely love,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, Nala, I will make it true to thee.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Thou mak'st it true,&quot; he said; &quot;thou sayest well,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sweet Damayanti; neither is there friend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To sad men given better than a wife.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I had not thought to leave thee, foolish Love!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Why didst thou fear? Alas, 't is from myself</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That I would fly&mdash;not thee, thou Faultless One!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Yet, if,&quot; the Princess answered, &quot;Maharaja!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou hadst no thought to leave me, why by thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was the way pointed to Vidarbha's walls?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I know thou wouldst not quit me, noblest Lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Being thyself, but only if thy mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were sore distraught; and see, thou gazest still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Along the southward road, my dread thereby</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Increasing, thou that wert as are the gods!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If it be thy fixed thought, 'Twere best she went</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto her people'&mdash;be it so; I go;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But hand in hand with thee. Thus let us fare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto Vidarbha, where the King, my sire,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Will greet thee well, and honor thee; and we</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Happy and safe within his gates shall dwell.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;As is thy father's kingdom,&quot; Nala said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;So, once, was mine. Be sure, whatever betide,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Never will I go thither! How, in sooth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Should I, who came there glorious, gladdening thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Creep back, thy shame and scorn, disconsolate?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So to sweet Damayanti spake the Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beguiling her, whom now one cloth scarce clad&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For but one garb they shared; and thus they strayed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hither and thither, faint for meat and drink,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Until a little hut they spied; and there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha's monarch, entering, sat him down</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On the bare ground, the Princess by his side&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vidarbha's glory, wearing that scant cloth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Without a mat, soiled by the dust and mire.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At Damayanti's side he sank asleep,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Outworn; and beauteous Damayanti slept,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spent with strange trials&mdash;- she so gently reared,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So soft and holy. But while slumbering thus,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No peaceful rest knew Nala. Trouble-tossed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He woke, forever thinking of his realm</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lost, lieges estranged, and all the griefs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of that wild wood. These on his heart came back,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, &quot;What if I shall do it? What, again,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If I shall do it not?&quot; So murmured he.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Would death be better, or to leave my Love?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For my sake she endures this woe, my fate</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Too fondly sharing; freed from me, her steps</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Would turn unto her people. At my side,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sure suffering is her portion; but apart,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>It might be she would somewhere comfort find.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thus with himself debating o'er and o'er,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Prince resolves abandonment were best.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;For how,&quot; saith he, &quot;should any in the wood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Harm her, so radiant in her grace, so good,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So noble, virtuous, faithful, famous, pure?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus mused his miserable mind, seduced</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Kali's cursed mischiefs to betray</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His sleeping wife. Then, seeing his loin-cloth gone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Damayanti clad, he drew anigh,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thinking to take of hers, and muttering,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;May I not rend one fold, and she not know?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So meditating, round the cabin crept</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Prince Nala, feeling up and down its walls;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, presently, within the purlieus found</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A naked knife, keen-tempered; therewithal</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shred he away a piece, and bound it on;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then made with desperate steps to seek the waste,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Leaving the Princess sleeping; but, anon,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Turns back again in changeful mood and glides</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into the hut, and, gazing wistfully</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On slumbering Damayanti, moans with tears:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Ah, Sweetheart! whom nor wind nor sun before</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hath ever rudely touched; thou to be couched</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In this poor hut, its floor thy bed, and I,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy lord, deserting thee, stealing from thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy last robe! O my Love with the bright smile,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My slender-waisted Queen! Will she not wake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To madness? Yea, and when she wanders lone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In the dark wood, haunted with beasts and snakes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How will it fare with Bhima's tender child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The bright and peerless? O my life, my wife!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May the great sun, may the Eight Powers of air,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Rudras, Maruts, and the A&#347;wins twain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Guard thee, thou true and dear one, on thy way!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So to his sleeping Queen&mdash;on all the earth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unmatched for beauty&mdash;spake he piteously;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then breaks away once more, by Kali driven.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But yet another and another time</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stole back into the hut, for one last gaze&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That way by Kali dragged, this way by love.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two hearts he had&mdash;the trouble-stricken Prince&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One beating &quot;Go,&quot; one throbbing &quot;Stay&quot;; and thus</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Backwards and forwards swung his mind between,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till, mastered by the sorrow and the spell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Frantic flies Nala, leaving there alone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That tender-sleeper, sighing as she slept.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He flies&mdash;the soulless prey of Kali flies;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still, while he hurries through the forest drear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thinking upon that sweet face he hath left.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Far distant (King!) was Nala, when, refreshed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The slender-waisted wakened, shuddering</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At the wood's silence; but when, seeking him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She found no Nala, sudden anguish seized</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her frightened heart, and, lifting high her voice,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Loud cries she: &quot;Maharaja! Nishadha's Prince!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ha, Lord! ha, Maharaja! ha, Master! why</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hast thou abandoned me? Now am I lost,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Am doomed, undone, left in this lonesome gloom.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wert thou not named, O Nala, true and just?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet art thou such, to quit me while I slept?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And hast thou so forsaken me, thy wife&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thine own fond wife&mdash;who never wrought thee wrong</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When by all others wrong was wrought on thee?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mak'st thou it good to me, now, Lord of men,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That love which long ago before the gods</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou didst proclaim? Alas! Death will not come,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Except at his appointed time to men,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And therefore for a little I shall live,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom thou hast lived to leave. Nay, 't is a jest!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, Truant, Runaway, enough thou play'st!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Come forth, my Lord!&mdash;I am afraid! Come forth!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Linger not, for I see&mdash;I spy thee there;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou art within yon thicket! Why not speak</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One word, Nishadha? Nala, cruel Prince!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou know'st me, lone, and comest not to calm</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My terrors, and be with me in my need.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Art gone indeed? Then I'll not mourn myself,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For whatso may befall me; I must think</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How desolate thou art, and weep for thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What wilt thou do, thirsty and hungry, spent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With wandering, when, at nightfall, 'mid the trees</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou hast me not, sweet Prince, to comfort thee?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thereat, distracted by her bitter fears,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like one whose heart is fire, forward and back</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She runs, hither and thither, weeping, wild.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One while she sinks to earth, one while she springs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Quick to her feet; now utterly overcome</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By fear and fasting, now by grief driven mad,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wailing and sobbing; till anon, with moans</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And broken sighs and tears, Bhima's fair child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The ever-faithful wife, speaks thus again:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;By whomsoever's spell this harm hath fall'n</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On Nishadha's Lord, I pray that evil one</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May bear a bitterer plague than Nala doth!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To him, whoever set my guileless Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On these ill deeds, I pray some direr might</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May bring far darker days, and life to live</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>More miserable still!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 13em;'>Thus, woe-begone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mourned that great-hearted wife her vanished lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeking him ever in the gloomy shades,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By wild beasts haunted. Roaming everywhere,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like one possessed, frantic, disconsolate,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Went Bhima's daughter. &quot;Ha, ha! Maharaja!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So crying runs she, so in every place</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is heard her ceaseless wail, as when is heard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fish-hawk's cry, which screams, and circling screams,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And will not stint complaining.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 18em;'>Suddenly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Straying too near his den, a serpent's coils</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seized Bhima's daughter. A prodigious snake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Glittering and strong, and furious for food,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Knitted about the Princess. She, o'erwhelmed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With horror, and the cold enfolding death,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spends her last breaths in pitiful laments</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For Nala, not herself. &quot;Ah, Prince!&quot; she cried,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;That would have saved me, who must perish now,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seized in the lone wood by this hideous snake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Why art thou not beside me? What will be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy thought, Nishadha! me remembering</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In days to come, when, from the curse set free,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou hast thy noble mind again, thyself,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy wealth&mdash;all save thy wife? Then thou'lt be sad,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be weary, wilt need food and drink; but I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall minister no longer. Who will tend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Love, my Lord, my Lion among kings,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My blameless Nala&mdash;Damayanti dead?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>That hour a hunter, roving through the brake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Heard her bewailing, and with quickened steps</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made nigh, and, spying a woman, almond-eyed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lovely, forlorn, by that fell monster knit,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He ran, and, as he came, with keen shaft clove,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through gaping mouth and crown, th'unwitting worm,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Slaying it. Then the woodman from its folds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Freed her, and laved the snake's slime from her limbs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With water of the pool, comforting her</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And giving food; and afterwards (my King!)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Inquiry made: &quot;What doest, in this wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou with the fawn's eyes? And how earnest thou,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My mistress, to such pit of misery?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And Damayanti, spoken fair by him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Recounted all which had befallen her.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But, gazing on her graces, scantly clad</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With half a cloth, those smooth, full sides, those breasts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beauteously swelling, form of faultless mould,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sweet youthful face, fair as the moon at full,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And dark orbs, by long curving lashes swept;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hearing her tender sighs and honeyed speech,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hunter fell to hot desire; he dared</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Essay to woo, with whispered words at first,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And next by amorous approach, the Queen;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who, presently perceiving what he would,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all that baseness of him&mdash;being so pure,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So chaste, and faithful&mdash;like a blazing torch</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Took fire of scorn and anger 'gainst the man,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her true soul burning at him, till the wretch,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wicked in heart, but impotent of will,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Glared on her, splendidly invincible</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In weakness, loftily defying wrong,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A living flame of lighted chastity.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She then&mdash;albeit so desolate, so lone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Abandoned by her lord, stripped of her state&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like a proud princess stormed, flinging away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All terms of supplication, cursing him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With wrath which scorched: &quot;If I am clean in heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And true in thought unto Nishadha's King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then mayest thou, vile pursuer of the beasts,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sink to the earth, stone dead!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 18em;'>While she did speak,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hunter breathless fell to earth, stone dead,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As falls a tree-trunk blasted by the bolt.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>That ravisher destroyed, the lotus-eyed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fared forward, threading still the fearful wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lonely and dim, with trill of jhillikas<a name="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a></span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Resounding, and fierce noise of many beasts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Laired in its shade, lions and leopards, deer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Close-hiding tigers, sullen bisons, wolves,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And shaggy bears. Also the glades of it</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were filled with fowl which crept, or flew, and cried.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A home for savage men and murderers,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thick with a world of trees, whereof was sal,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sharp-seeded, weeping gum; knotted bambus,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dhavas with twisted roots; smooth aswatthas,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Large-leaved, and creeping through the cloven rocks;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tindukas, iron-fibred, dark of grain;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ingudas, yielding oil; and kinsukas,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With scarlet flowerets flaming. Thronging these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were arjuns and arishta-clumps, which bear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The scented purple clusters; syandans,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And tall silk-cotton trees, and mango-belts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With silvery spears; and wild rose-apple, blent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Mid lodhra-tufts and khadirs, interknit</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By clinging rattans, climbing everywhere</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From stem to stem. Therewith were intermixed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Round pools where rocked the lotus&mdash;&acirc;malaks,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Plakshas with fluted leaves, kadambas sweet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Udumbaras; and, on the jungle-edge,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tangles of reed and jujube, whence there rose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bel-trees and nyagrodhas, dropping roots</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Down from the air; broad-leaved priy&acirc;las, palms</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And date-trees, and the gold myrobalan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With copper-leaved vibh&icirc;tikas. All these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Crowded the wood; and many a crag it held,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With precious ore of metals interveined;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And many a creeper-covered cave wherein</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The spoken word rolled round; and many a cleft</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where the thick stems were like a wall to see;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And many a winding stream and reedy jheel,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And glassy lakelet, where the woodland beasts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In free peace gathered.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 14em;'>Wandering onward thus,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess saw far-gliding forms of dread&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pis&acirc;chas, Rakshasas, ill sprites and fiends</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which haunt, with swinging snakes, the undergrowth.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dark pools she saw, and drinking-holes, and peaks</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wherefrom break down in tumbling cataracts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wild white waters, marvellous to hear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Also she passed&mdash;this daughter of a king&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where snorted the fierce buffaloes, and where</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gray boars rooted for their food, and where</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The black bears growled, and serpents in the grass</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rustled and hissed. But all along that way</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Safe paced she in her majesty of grace,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High fortune, courage, constancy, and right&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vidarbha's glory&mdash;seeking, all alone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lost Nala; and less terror at these sights</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Came to sad Damayanti for herself&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Threading this dreadful forest&mdash;than for him.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Most was her mind on Nala's fate intent.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bitterly grieving stood the sweet Princess</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon a rock, her tender limbs a-thrill</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With heavy fears for Nala while she spake:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Broad-chested Chief! my long-armed Lord of men!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha's King! Ah! whither art thou gone.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Leaving me thus in the unpeopled wood?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The A&#347;wamedha sacrifice thou mad'st,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all the rites and royal gifts hast given,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A lion-hearted Prince, holy and true</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To all save me! That which thou didst declare,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hand in hand with me&mdash;once so fond and kind&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Recall it now&mdash;thy sacred word, thy vow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whithersoever, Raja, thou art fled.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Think how the message of the gold-winged swans</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was spoken, by thine own lips, then to me!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>True men keep faith; this is the teaching taught</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In Vedas, Angas, and Upangas all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hear which we may; wilt thou not, therefore, Prince&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wilt thou not, terror of thy foes, keep faith,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Making thy promise good to cleave to me?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ha, Nala, Lord! Am I not surely still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy chosen, thy beloved? Answerest not</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy wife in this dark, horror-haunted shade?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The tyrant of the jungle, fierce and fell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With jaws agape to take me, crouches nigh,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thou not here to rescue me&mdash;not thou,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who saidst none other in the world was dear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But Damayanti! Prove the fond speech true,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Uttered so often! Why repliest not</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To me, thy well-beloved; me, distraught,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Longed for and longing; me, my Prince and pride,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That am so weary, weak, and miserable,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stained with the mire, in this torn cloth half clad,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Alone and weeping, seeing no help near?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, stag of all the herd! leav'st thou thy hind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Astray, regarding not these tears which roll?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Nala, Maharaja! It is I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who cry, thy Damayanti, true and pure,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lost in the wood, and still thou answerest not!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High-born, high-hearted, full of grace and strength</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In all thy limbs, shall I not find thee soon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On yonder hill? Shall I not see, at last,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In some track of this grim, beast-peopled wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Standing, or seated, or upon the leaves</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lying, or coming, him who is of men</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The glory, but for me the grief-maker?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If not, whom shall I question, woe-begone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saying, 'In any region of this wood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hast thou, perchance, seen Nala?' Is there none,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In all the forest, would reply to me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With tidings of my lord, wandered away,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kingly in mind and form, of hosts of foes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The conqueror? Who will say, with blessed voice,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'That Raja with the lotus-eyes is near,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom thou dost seek'?&mdash;Nay, here comes one to ask,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The yellow forest-king, his great jaws armed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With fourfold fangs. A tiger standeth now</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Face to face on my path; I'll speak with him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fearlessly: 'Dreadful chief of all this waste,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou art the sovereign of the beasts, and I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Am daughter of Vidarbha's King; my name,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess Damayanti; know thou me,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wife of Nishadha's Lord&mdash;of Nala&mdash;styled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Subduer of his Foes&quot;? Him seek I here&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Abandoned, sorrow-stricken, miserable.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Comfort me, mighty beast, if so thou canst,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saying thou hast seen Nala; but if this</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou canst not do, then, ah, thou savage lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Terrible friend, devour me, setting me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Free from all woes!' The tiger answereth not;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He turns, and quits me in my tears, to stalk</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Down where the river glitters through the reeds,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeking its seaward way. Then will I pray</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto yon sacred mount of clustered crags,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Broad-shouldered, shining, lifting high to heaven</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Its diverse-colored peaks, where the mind climbs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Its hid heart rich with silver veins, and gold,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And stored with many a precious gem unseen.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Clear towers it o'er the forest, broad and bright</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like a green banner; and the sides of it</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>House many a living thing&mdash;lions and boars,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tigers and elephants, and bears and deer.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Softly around me from its feathered flocks</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The songs ring, perched upon the kinsuk trees,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The asokas, vakuls, and punn&acirc;ga boughs,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or hidden in the karnikara leaves,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And tendrils of the dhava or the fig;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Full of great glens it soars, where waters leap</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bright birds lave. This king of hills I sue</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For tidings of my lord. O Mountain Lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Far-seen and celebrated hill! that cleav'st</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The blue of the sky, refuge of living things,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Most noble eminence, I worship thee;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thee I salute, who am a monarch's child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The daughter and the consort of a prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The high-born Damayanti, unto whom</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bhima, Vidarbha's chief&mdash;that puissant lord&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was sire, renowned o'er earth. Protector he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the four castes, performer of the rites</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Called Rajasuya and the A&#347;wamedha&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A bounteous giver, first of rulers, known</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For his large shining eyes; holy and just,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fast to his word, unenvious, sweet of speech,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gentle and valiant, dutiful and pure;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The guardian of Vidarbha, of his foes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The slayer. Know me, O Majestic Mount!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For that King's daughter, bending low to thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In Nishadha lived the father of my lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Maharaja Virasena named,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wealthy and great; whose son, of regal blood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High-fortuned, powerful, and noble-souled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ruleth by right the realm paternal: he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is Nala, terror of all enemies;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dark Nala, praised-in-song; Nala the just,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The pure; deep-seen in scriptures, sweet of speech,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Drinker of Soma-juice, and worshipper</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Agni; sacrificing, giving gifts;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>First in the wars, a perfect, princely lord.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His wife am I, Great Mountain! and come here</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fortuneless, husbandless, and spiritless,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Everywhere seeking him, my best of men.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O Mount, whose doubled ridge stamps on the sky</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yon line, by fivescore splendid pinnacles</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Indented! tell me, in this gloomy wood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hast thou seen Nala? Nala, wise and bold,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like a tusked elephant for might; long armed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Indomitable, gallant, glorious, true;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala, Nishadha's chief&mdash;hast thou seen him?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O Mountain, why consolest thou me not,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Answering one word to sorrowful, distressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lonely, lost Damayanti?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 14em;'>Then she cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;But answer for thyself, Hero and Lord!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If thou art in the forest, show thyself!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Alas! when shall I hear that voice, as low,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As tender as the murmur of the rain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When great clouds gather; sweet as Amrit-drink?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy voice, once more, my Nala, calling to me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Full softly, 'Damayanti!'&mdash;dearest Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That would be music soothing to these ears</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As sound of sacred Veda; that would stay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My pains and comfort me, and bring me peace.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thereafter, turning from the mount, she went</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Northwards, and journeying on three nights and days</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Came to a green incomparable grove</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By holy men inhabited; a haunt</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Placid as Paradise, whose indwellers</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like to Va&#347;istha, Bhrigu, Atri, were&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those ancient saints. Restraining sense they lived,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Heedful in meats, subduing passion, pure,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Breathing within; their food water and herbs;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ascetics; very holy; seeking still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The heavenward road; clad in the bark of trees</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And skins&mdash;all gauds of earth being put by.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This hermitage, peopled by gentle ones,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Glad Damayanti spied, circled with herds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of wild things grazing fearless, and with troops</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of monkey-folk o'erheard; and when she saw,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her heart was lightened, for its quietness.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So drew she nigh&mdash;that lovely wanderer&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bright-browed, long-tressed, large-hipped, full-bosomed, fair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With pearly teeth and honeyed mouth, in gait</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Right queenly still, having those long black eyes&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wife of Virasena's son, the gem</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of all dear women, glory of her time;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sad Damayanti entered their abode,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those holy men saluting reverently,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With modest body bowed. Thus stood she there</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all the saints spake gently, &quot;<i>Sw&acirc;gatam</i>&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Welcome!&quot; and gave the greetings which are meet;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And afterwards, &quot;Repose thyself,&quot; they said;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;What wouldst thou have of us?&quot; Then, with soft words</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The slender-waisted spake: &quot;Of all these here,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So worshipful in sacrifice and rite&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Mid gentle beasts and birds&mdash;in tasks and toils</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And blameless duties&mdash;is it well?&quot; And they</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Answered: &quot;We thank you, noble lady, well.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tell us, most beauteous one, thy name, and say</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What thou desirest. Seeing thee so fair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So worthy, yet so sorrowful, our minds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are lost in wonder. Weep not. Comfort take.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Art thou the goddess of the wood? Art thou</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Mountain-Yakshi, or, belike, some sprite</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which lives under the river? Tell us true,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gentle and faultless form!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 16.5em;'>Whereat reply</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus made she to the Rishis: &quot;None of these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Am I, good saints. No goddess of the wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor yet a mountain nor a river sprite;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A woman ye behold, most only ones,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose moving story I will tell you true.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Raja of Vidarbha is my sire,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bhima his name, and&mdash;Best of Twice-born!&mdash;know</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My husband is Nishadha's Chief, the famed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wise and valiant and victorious Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The high and lordly Nala; of the gods</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A steadfast worshipper; of Br&aacute;hmanas</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The friend; his people's shield; honored and strong,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Truth-speaking, skilled in arms, sagacious, just;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Terrible to his foes, fortunate, lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of many conquered towns; a godlike man,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Princeliest of princes&mdash;Nala&mdash;one that hath</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A countenance like the full moon's for light,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And eyes of lotus. This true offerer</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of sacrifices, this close votary</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Vedas and Ved&acirc;ngas, in the war</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deadly to enemies, like sun and moon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For splendor&mdash;by some certain evil ones</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Being defied to dice, my virtuous Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was, by their wicked acts, of realm despoiled&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wealth, jewels, all. I am his woful wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess Damayanti. Seeking him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through thickets have I roamed, over rough hills,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By crag and river and the reedy lake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By marsh and waterfall and jungle-bush,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In quest of him&mdash;my lord, my warrior,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My hero&mdash;and still roam, uncomforted.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Worshipful brethren! say if he hath come&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha's Chief, my Nala, hitherward</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto your pleasant homes&mdash;he, for whose sake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I wander in the dismal pathless wood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With bears and tigers haunted&mdash;terrible!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah! if I find him not, ere there be passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Many more nights and days, peace will I win;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For death shall set my mournful spirit free.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What cause have I to live, lacking my Prince?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Why should I longer breathe, whose heart is dead</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With sorrow for my lord?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 15.5em;'>To Bhima's child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So in the wood bewailing, made reply</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those holy, truthful men: &quot;Beautiful One!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The future is for thee; fair will it fall!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our eyes, by long devotions opened, see&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even now&mdash;thy lord; thou shalt behold him soon,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha's chief, the famous Nala, strong</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In battle, loving justice. Yea, this Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou wilt regain, Bhima's sad daughter! freed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From troubles, purged of sin; and witness him&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With all his gems and glories&mdash;governing</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha once again, invincible,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Joy of his friends and terror of his foes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yea, Noblest, thou shalt have thy love anew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In days to come.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 11em;'>So speaking, from the sight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Damayanti, at that instant, passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hermits, with hermitage and holy fires,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Evanishing. In wonderment she stood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gazing bewildered. Then the Princess cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Was it in dream I saw them? Whence befell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This unto me? Where are the brethren gone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The ring of huts, the pleasant stream that ran</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With birds upon its crystal banks, the grove</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Delightful, with its fruits and flowers?&quot; Long while</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pondered and wondered Damayanti there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her bright smile fled, pale, strengthless, sorrowful;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then to another region of the wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With sighs, and eyes welling great tears, she passed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lamenting; till a beauteous tree she spied&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Asoka, best of trees. Fair rose it there</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beside the forest, glowing with the flame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of golden and crimson blossoms, and its boughs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Full of sweet-singing birds.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 16.5em;'>&quot;<i>Ahovat</i>&mdash;Look!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She cried: &quot;Ah, lovely tree, that wavest here</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy crown of countless, shining, clustering blooms</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As thou wert woodland king&mdash;Asoka tree,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tree called 'the sorrow-ender,' heart's-ease tree!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be what thy name saith&mdash;end my sorrow now,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saying, ah, bright Asoka! thou hast seen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Prince, my dauntless Nala; seen that lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom Damayanti loves and his foes fear;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seen great Nishadha's Chief, so dear to me,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His tender princely skin in rended cloth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scantily clad. Hath he passed wandering</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Under thy branches, grievously forlorn?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Answer, Asoka! 'Sorrow-ender,' speak!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That I go sorrowless, O heart's-ease, be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Truly heart-easing&mdash;ease my heart of pain.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thus, wild with grief, she spake unto the tree,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Round and round walking, as to reverence it;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And then, unanswered, the sweet lady sped</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through wastes more dreadful, passing many a</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Many still-gliding rillets, many a peak</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tree-clad, with beasts and birds of wondrous kind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In dark ravines, and caves, and lonely glooms.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These things saw Damayanti, Bhima's child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeking her lord.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 11em;'>At last, on the long road,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She, whose soft smile was once so beautiful,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A caravan encountered. Merchantmen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With trampling horses, elephants, and wains,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made passage of a river, running slow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In cool, clear waves. The quiet waters gleamed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shining and wide outspread, between the canes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which bordered it, wherefrom echoed the cries</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of fish-hawks, curlews, and red chakrav&acirc;ks,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With sounds of leaping fish and water-snakes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And tortoises, amid its shoals and flats</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sporting or feeding.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 12.5em;'>When she spied that throng&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Heart-maddened with her anguish, weak and wan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Half clad, bloodless and thin, her long black locks</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Matted with dust&mdash;breathlessly breaks she in</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon them&mdash;Nala's wife&mdash;so beauteous once,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So honored. Seeing her, some fled in fear;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Some gazed, speechless with wonder; some called out,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mocking the piteous face by words of scorn;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But some (my King!) had pity of her woe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And spake her fair, inquiring: &quot;Who art thou?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And whence? And in this grove what seekest thou,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To come so wild? Thy mien astonisheth.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Art of our kind, or art thou something strange,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The spirit of the forest, or the hill,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or river valley? Tell us true; then we</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Will buy thy favor. If, indeed, thou art</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yakshini, Rakshasi, or she-creature</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Haunting this region, be propitious! Send</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our caravan in safety on its path,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That we may quickly, by thy fortune, go</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Homeward, and all fair chances fall to us.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Hereby accosted, softly gave response</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That royal lady&mdash;weary for her lord&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Answering the leader of the caravan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And those that gathered round, a marvelling throng</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of men and boys and elders: &quot;Oh, believe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I am as you, of mortal birth, but born</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A Raja's child, and made a Raja's wife.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Him seek I, Chieftain of Nishadha, named</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Prince Nala&mdash;famous, glorious, first in war.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If ye know aught of him, my king, my joy,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My tiger of the jungle, my lost lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Quick, tell me, comfort me!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 15.5em;'>Then one who led</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their line&mdash;the merchant &#346;uchi&mdash;answering,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spake to the peerless Princess: &quot;Hear me now.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I am the captain of this caravan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But nowhere any named by Nala's name</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Have I, or these, beheld. Of evil beasts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The woods were full&mdash;cheetahs and bears and cats,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tigers and elephants, bison and boar;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those saw we in the brake on every side,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But nowhere nought of human shape, save thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May Manibhadra have us in his grace&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Lord of Yakshas&mdash;as I tell thee truth!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then sadly spake she to the trader-chief</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And to his band: &quot;Whither wend ye, I pray?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Please ye, acquaint me where this S&acirc;rth&acirc;<a name="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> goes.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Replied the captain: &quot;Unto Chedi's realm,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where rules the just Sub&acirc;hu, journey we,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To sell our merchandise, daughter of men!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thus by the chieftain of the band informed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The peerless Princess journeyed with them, still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeking her lord. And at the first the way</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fared through another forest, dark and deep;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Afterwards came the traders to a pool</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Broad, everywhere delightful, odorous</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With cups of opened lotus, and its shores</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Green with rich grass, and edged with garden trees&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A place of flowers and fruits and singing birds.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So cool and clear and peacefully it gleamed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That men and cattle, weary with the march,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Clamored to pitch; and, on their chieftain's sign,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The pleasant hollow entered they, and camped&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All the long caravan&mdash;at sunset's hour.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>There, in the quiet of the middle night,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deep slumbered these; when, sudden on them fell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A herd of elephants, thirsting to drink,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In rut, the mada<a name="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> oozing from their heads.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when those great beasts spied the caravan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And smelled the tame cows of their kind, they rushed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Headlong, and, mad with must, overwhelming all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With onset vast and irresistible.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As when from some tall peak into the plain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thunder and smoke and crash the rolling rocks,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through splintered stems and thorns breaking their path,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So swept the herd to where, beside the pool,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those sleepers lay; and trampled them to earth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Half-risen, helpless, shrieking in the dark,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Haha! the elephants!&quot; Of those unslain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Some in the thickets sought a shelter; some,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet dazed with sleep, stood panic-stricken, mute;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till here with tusks, and there with trunks, the beasts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gored them, and battered them, and trod them flat</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Under their monstrous feet. Then might be seen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Camels with camel-drivers, perishing,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And men flying in fear, who struck at men&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Terror and death and clamor everywhere:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While some, despairing, cast themselves to earth;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And some, in fleeing, fell and died; and some</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Climbed to the tree-tops. Thus on every side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scattered and ruined was that caravan&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Cattle and merchants&mdash;by the herd assailed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So hideous was the tumult,-all three worlds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seemed filled with fright; and one was heard to cry:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The fire is in the tents! fly for your lives!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stay not!&quot; And others cried: &quot;Look where we leave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our treasures trodden down; gather them! Halt!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Why run ye, losing ours and yours? Nay, stay!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stand ye, and we will stand!&quot; And then to these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One voice cried, &quot;Stand!&quot; another, &quot;Fly! we die!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Answered by those again who shouted, &quot;Stand!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Think what we lose, O cowards!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 18em;'>While this rout</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Raged, amid dying groans and sounds of fear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess, waking startled, terror-struck,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saw such a sight as might the boldest daunt&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such scene as those great lovely lotus-eyes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ne'er gazed upon before. Sick with new dread&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her breath suspended 'twixt her lips&mdash;she rose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And heard, of those surviving, some one moan</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Amidst his fellows: &quot;From whose evil act</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is this the fruit? Hath worship not been paid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To mighty Manibhadra? Gave we not</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The reverence due to Vaishravan, that King</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of all the Yakshas? Was not offering made</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At outset to the spirits which impede?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is this the evil portent of the birds?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were the stars adverse? or what else hath fall'n?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And others said, wailing for friends and goods:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Who was that woman, with mad eyes, that came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into our camp, ill-favored, hardly cast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In mortal mould? By her, be sure, was wrought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This direful sorcery. Demon or witch,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yaksh&icirc; or Rakshas&icirc;, or gliding ghost,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or something frightful, was she. Hers this deed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of midnight murders; doubt there can be none.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, if we could espy that hateful one,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The ruin of our march, the woe-maker,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With stones, clods, canes, or clubs, nay, with clenched fists,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We'd strike her dead, the murderess of our band!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Trembling the Princess heard those angry words;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And&mdash;saddened, maddened, shamed&mdash;breathless she fled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into the thicket, doubtful if such sin</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Might not be hers, and with fresh dread distressed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Aho!&quot; she weeps, &quot;pitiless grows the wrath</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Fate against me. Not one gleam of good</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Arriveth. Of what fault is this the fruit?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I cannot call to mind a wrong I wrought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To any&mdash;even a little thing&mdash;in act</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or thought or word; whence then hath come this curse?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Belike from ill deeds done in by-gone lives</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>It hath befall'n, and what I suffer now</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is payment of old evils undischarged.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Grievous the doom&mdash;my palace lost, my lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My children, kindred; I am torn away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From home and love and all, to roam accurst</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In this plague-haunted waste!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 17.5em;'>When broke the day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those which escaped alive, with grievous cries</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Departed, mourning for their fellows slain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each one a kinsman or a friend laments&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Father or brother, son, or comrade dear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And Damayanti, hearing, weeps anew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saying: &quot;What dreadful sin was that I wrought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Long, long ago, which, when I chance to meet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These wayfarers in the unpeopled wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dooms them to perish by the elephants,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In my dark destiny enwrapped? No doubt</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>More and more sorrow I shall bear, or bring,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For none dies ere his time; this is the lore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of ancient sages; this is why&mdash;being glad</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If I could die&mdash;I was not trampled down</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Under the elephants. There haps to man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nothing unless by destiny. Why else,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeing that never have I wrought one wrong,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From childhood's hours, in thought or word or deed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hath this woe chanced? May be&mdash;meseems it may!&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mighty gods, at my Swayamvara</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Slighted by me for Nala's dearest sake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are wroth, and by their dread displeasure thus</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To loss and loneliness I am consigned!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So&mdash;woe-begone and wild&mdash;this noble wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deserted Damayanti, poured her griefs:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And afterwards, with certain Br&aacute;hmanas</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saved from the rout&mdash;good men who knew the Veds&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sadly her road she finished, like the moon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That goeth clouded in the month of rain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus travelling long, the Princess drew at last</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nigh to a city, at the evening hour.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The dwelling-place it was of Chedi's Chief,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The just Sub&acirc;hu. Through its lofty gates</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Painfully passed she, clad in half a cloth;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And as she entered&mdash;sorrow-stricken, wan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Foot-weary, stained with mire, with unsmoothed hair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unbathed, and eyes of madness&mdash;those who saw,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wondered and stared, and watched her as she toiled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Down the long city street. The children break</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From play, and&mdash;boys with girls&mdash;followed her steps,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So that she came&mdash;a crowd encompassing&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto the King's door. On the palace roof</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mother of the Maharaja paced,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And marked the throng, and that sad wayfarer.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then to her nurse spake the queen-mother this:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Go thou, and bring yon woman unto me!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The people trouble her; mournful she walks,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeming unfriended, yet bears she a mien</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made for a king's abode, and, all so wild,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still are her wistful eyes like the great eyes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Lakshmi's self.&quot; So downwards went the nurse,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bidding the rude folk back; and to the roof</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the great palace led that wandering one&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Desolate Damayanti&mdash;whom the Queen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Courteous besought: &quot;Though thou art wan of face,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou wear'st a noble air, which through thy griefs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shineth as lightning doth behind its cloud.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tell me thy name, and whose thou art, and whence.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No lowborn form is thine, albeit thou com'st</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wearing no ornaments; and all alone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wanderest&mdash;not fearing men&mdash;by some spell safe.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Hearing which words, the child of Bhima spake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gratefully this: &quot;A woful woman I,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And woful wife, but faithful to my vows;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High-born, but like a servant, like a slave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lodging where it may hap, and finding food</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From the wild roots and fruits wherever night</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Brings me my resting-place. Yet is my lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A prince noble and great, with countless gifts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Endued; and him I followed faithfully</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As 't were his shadow, till hard fate decreed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That he should fall into the rage of dice:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, worsted in that play, into the wood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He fled, clad in one cloth, frenzied and lone.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And I his steps attended in the wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Comforting him, my husband. But it chanced,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hungry and desperate, he lost his cloth;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And I&mdash;one garment bearing&mdash;followed still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My unclad lord, despairing, reasonless,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through many a weary night not slumbering.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But when, at length, a little while I slept,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Prince abandoned me, rending away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Half of my garment, leaving there his wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who never wrought him wrong. That lord I seek</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By day and night, with heart and soul on fire&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seek, but still find not; though he is to me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Brighter than light which gleams from lotus-cups,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Divine as are the immortals, dear as breath,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The master of my life, my pride, my joy!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Whom, grieving so, her sweet eyes blind with tears,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gently addressed Sub&acirc;hu's mother&mdash;sad</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To hear as she to tell. &quot;Stay with us here,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou ill-starred lady. Great the friendliness</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I have for thee. The people of our court</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall thy lost husband seek; or, it may be,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He too will wander hither of himself</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By devious paths: yea, mournful one, thy lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou wilt regain, abiding with us here.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And Damayanti, bowing, answered thus</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto the Queen: &quot;I will abide with thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O mother of illustrious sons, if so</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They feed me not on orts, nor seek from me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To wash the feet of comers, nor that I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be set to speak with any stranger-men</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before the curtain; and, if any man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sue me, that he be punished; and if twice,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then that he die, guilty of infamy.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This is my earnest prayer; but Br&aacute;hmanas</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who seek my husband, or bear news of him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such will I speak with. If it may be thus,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gladly would I abide, great lady, here;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If otherwise, it is not on my mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To sojourn longer.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 14em;'>Very tenderly</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Quoth the queen-mother: &quot;All that thou dost ask</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We will ordain. The gods reward thy love,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which hath such honor!&quot; Comforting her so,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To the king's daughter, young Sunand&acirc;, spake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Maharajni: &quot;See, Sunand&acirc;, here</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Clad as a handmaid, but in form divine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One of thy years, gentle and true. Be friends;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Take and give pleasure in glad company</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each with the other, keeping happy hearts.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So went Sunand&acirc; joyous to her house,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Leading with loving hand the Princess in,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The maidens of the court accompanying.</span><br />
<br /></div>

<a name='ND_Part_II'></a><h4><b>Part II.</b></h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Not long (O Maharaja!) was Nala fled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From Damayanti, when, in midmost gloom</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the thick wood a flaming fire he spied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And from the fire's heart heard proceed a voice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of one imperilled, crying many times:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Haste hither, Punyashloka, Nala, haste!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Fear not,&quot; the Prince replied; &quot;I come!&quot; and sprang</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Across the burning bushes, where he saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A snake&mdash;a king of serpents&mdash;lying curled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In a great ring, which reared its dancing crest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saluting, and in human accents spoke:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Maharaja, kindly lord, I am the snake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kark&ocirc;taka; by me was once betrayed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The famous Rishi Narada; his wrath</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Doomed me, thou Chief of men! to bear this spell&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Coil thy false folds,' said he, 'forever here,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A serpent, motionless upon this spot,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till it shall chance that Nala passeth by</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bears thee hence; then only from my curse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Canst thou be freed,' And prisoned by that curse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I have no power to stir, though the wood burns;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nay, not a coil! good fellowship I'll show</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If thou wilt succor me. I'll be to thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A faithful friend, as no snake ever yet.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lift me, and quickly from the flames bear forth:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For thee I shall grow light.&quot; Thereat shrank up</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That monstrous reptile to a finger's length;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And grasping this, unto a place secure</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From burning, Nala bore it, where the air</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Breathed freshly, and the fire's black path was stayed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then made the Prince to lay the serpent down,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But yet again it speaks: &quot;Nishadha's Lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Grasp me and slowly go, counting thy steps;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For, Raja, thou shalt have good fortune hence.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So Nala slowly went, counting his steps;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when the tenth pace came, the serpent turned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bit the Prince. No sooner pierced that tooth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Than all the likeness of Nishadha changed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, wonder-struck, he gazed upon himself;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While from the dust he saw the snake arise</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A man, and, speaking as Kark&ocirc;taka,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Comfort him thus:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 12em;'>&quot;Thou art by me transformed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That no man know thee: and that evil one</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(Possessing, and undoing thee, with grief)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall so within thee by my venom smart,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall through thy blood so ache, that&mdash;till he quit&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He shall endure the woe he did impart.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus by my potent spell, most noble Prince!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(Who sufferest too long) thou wilt be freed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From him that haunts thee. Fear no more the wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou tiger of all princes! fear thou not</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Horned nor fanged beasts, nor any enemies,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though they be Br&aacute;hmans! safe thou goest now,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Guarded from grief and hurt&mdash;Chieftain of men!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By this kind poison. In the fields of war</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Henceforth the victory always falls to thee;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Go joyous, therefore, Prince; give thyself forth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For 'Vah&ucirc;ka, the charioteer:' repair</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Rituparna's city, who is skilled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In play, and dwells in fair Ayodhy&acirc;.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wend thou, Nishadha! thither; he will teach</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Great subtlety in numbers unto thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Exchanging this for thine own matchless gift</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of taming horses. From the lordly line</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Descended of Ikshvaku, glad and kind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The King will be; and thou, learning of him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His deepest act of dice, wilt win back all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And clasp again thy Princess. Therefore waste</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No thought on woes. I tell thee truth! thy realm</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou shalt regain; and when the time is come</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That thou hast need to put thine own form on,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Call me to mind, O Prince, and tie this cloth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Around thy body. Wearing it, thy shape</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou shalt resume.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 11.5em;'>Therewith the serpent gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A magic twofold robe, not wove on earth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which (O thou son of Kuru!) Nala took;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And so the snake, transformed, vanished away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The great snake being gone, Nishadha's Chief</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Set forth, and on the tenth day entered in</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At Rituparna's town; there he besought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The presence of the Raja, and spake thus:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;I am the chariot-driver, Vah&ucirc;ka.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There is not on this earth another man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hath gifts like mine to tame and guide the steed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Moreover, thou mayest use me in nice needs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And dangerous, where kings lack faithful hearts.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Specially skilful I am in dressing meats;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And whatso other duties may befall,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though they be weighty, I shall execute,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If, Rituparna, thou wilt take me in.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;I take thee,&quot; quoth the King. &quot;Dwell here with me.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such service as thou knowest, render us.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis, Vah&ucirc;ka, forever in my heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To have my steeds the swiftest; be thy task</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To train me horses like the wind for speed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My charioteer I make thee, and thy wage</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ten thousand gold suvernas. Thou wilt have</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For fellows, Varshneya and Jivala;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With those abiding, lodge thou happy here.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So entertained and honored of the King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In Rituparna's city Nala dwelled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lodging with Varshneya and Jivala.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>There sojourned he (my Raja!), thinking still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of sweet Vidarbha's Princess day by day;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sunset after sunset one sad strain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He sang: &quot;Where resteth she that roamed the wood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hungry and parched and worn, but always true?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Doth she remember yet her faultful lord?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, who is near her now?&quot; So it befell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Jivala heard him ever sighing thus,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And questioned: &quot;Who is she thou dost lament?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Say, Vah&ucirc;ka! fain would I know her name.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Long life be thine; but tell me who he is,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The faultful man that was the lady's lord.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And Nala answered him: &quot;There lives a man,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Evil and rash, that had a noble wife.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>False to his word he was; and thus it fell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That somewhere, for some reason (ask not me!),</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He quitted her, this rash one. And&mdash;so wrenched</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Apart from hers&mdash;his spirit, bad and sad,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Muses and moans, with grief's slow fire consumed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Night-time and day-time. Thence it is he sings</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At every sunset this unchanging verse,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>An outcast on the earth, by hazard led</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hither and thither. Such a man thou seest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Woful, unworthy, holding in his heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Always that sin. I was that lady's lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom she did follow through the dreadful wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Living by me abandoned, at this hour;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If yet, in truth, she lives&mdash;youthful, alone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unpractised in the ways, not meriting</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fortunes so hard. Ah, if indeed she lives,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who roamed the thick and boundless forest, full</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of prowling beasts&mdash;roamed it, my Jivala,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unguarded by her guilty lord&mdash;forsook,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Betrayed, good friend!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 13.5em;'>Thus did Nishadha grieve,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Calling sweet Damayanti to his mind.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So tarried he within the Raja's house,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And no man knew his place of sojourning.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>While, stripped of state, the Prince and Princess thus</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were sunk to servitude, Bhima made quest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sending his Br&aacute;hmans forth to search for them</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With straight commands, and for their road-money</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Liberal store. &quot;Seek everywhere,&quot; said he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto the twice-born, &quot;Nala&mdash;everywhere</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My daughter Damayanti. Whoso comes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Successful in this quest, discovering her&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With lost Nishadha's Lord&mdash;and bringing them,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A thousand cows to that man will I give,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And village-lands whence shall be revenue</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As great as from a city. If so be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ye cannot bring me Nala and my child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To him that learns their refuge I will give</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The thousand cows.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 11.5em;'>Thereby rejoiced, they went,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those Br&aacute;hmans, hither and thither, up and down,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into all regions, rajaships, and towns,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeking Nishadha's Chieftain, and his wife.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But Nala nowhere found they; nowhere found</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sweet Damayanti, Bhima's beauteous child&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Until, straying to pleasant Chedipur,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One day a twice-born came, Sud&ecirc;va named,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And entered it; and, spying round about</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(Upon a feast-day by the King proclaimed),</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He saw forth-passing through the palace gate</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A woman&mdash;Bhima's daughter&mdash;side by side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With young Sunand&acirc;. Little praise had now</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That beauty which in old days shone so bright;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Marred with much grief it was, like sunlight dimmed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By fold on fold of wreathed and creeping mists.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But when Sud&ecirc;va marked the great dark eyes&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lustreless though they were, and she so worn,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So listless&mdash;&quot;Lo, the Princess!&quot; whispered he;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;'Tis the King's daughter,&quot; quoth he to himself;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus mused on:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 12em;'>&quot;Yea! as I used to see,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis she! no other woman hath such grace!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My task is done; I gaze on that one form,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which is like Lakshmi's, whom all worlds adore.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I see the bosoms, rounded, dark, and smooth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As they were sister-moons; the soft moon-face</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which with its queenly light makes all things bright</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where it doth gleam; the large deep lotus-eyes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That, like to Rati's own, the Queen of Love,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beam, each a lovelit star, filling the worlds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With longing. Ah, fair lotus-flower, plucked up</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Fate's hard grasp from far Vidarbha's pool,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How is thy cup muddied and slimed to-day!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, moon, how is thy night like to the eclipse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When Rahu swallows up the silver round!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, tearless eyes, reddened with weeping him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How are ye like to gentle streams run dry!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, lake of lilies, where grief's elephant</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hath swung his trunk, and turned the crystal black,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And scattered all the blue and crimson cups,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And frightened off the birds! Ah, lily-cup,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tender, and delicately leaved, and reared</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To blossom in a palace built of gems,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How dost thou wither here, wrenched by the root,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sun-scorched and faded! Noblest, loveliest, best!&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who bear'st no gems, yet so becomest them&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How like the new moon's silver horn thou art,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When envious black clouds blot it! Lost for thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are love, home, children, friends, and kinsmen; lost</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All joy of that fair body thou dost wear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Only that it may last to find thy lord.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Truly a woman's ornament is this:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The husband is her jewel; lacking him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She hath none, though she shines with priceless pearls;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Piteous must be her state! And, torn from her,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Doth Nala cling to life; or, day by day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Waste with long yearning? Oh, as I behold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those black locks, and those eyes&mdash;dark and long-shaped</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As are the hundred-petalled lotus-leaves&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And watch her joyless who deserves all joy,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My heart is sore! When will she overpass</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The river of this sorrow, and come safe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto its farther shore? When will she meet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her lord, as moon and moon-star in the sky</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mingle? For, as I think, in winning her,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala would win his happy days again,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And&mdash;albeit banished now&mdash;have back his lands.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Alike in years and graces, and alike</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In lordly race these were: no bride could seem</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Worthy Nishadha, if it were not she;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor husband worthy of Vidarbha's Pride,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Save it were Nala. It is meet I bring</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Comfort forthwith to yon despairing one,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The consort of the just and noble Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For whom I see her heart-sick. I will go</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And speak good tidings to this moon-faced Queen,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who once knew nought of sorrows, but to-day</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stands yonder, plunged heart-deep in woful thought.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So, all those signs and marks considering</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which stamped her Bhima's child, Sud&ecirc;va drew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nearer, and said: &quot;Vidarbhi, Nala's wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I am the Br&aacute;hmana Sud&ecirc;va, friend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto my lord, thy brother, and I come</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By royal Bhima's mandate, seeking thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That Maharaja, thy father, dwells in health;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy mother and thy house are well; and well&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With promise of long years&mdash;thy little ones,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sister and brother. Yet, for thy sake, Queen,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy kindred sit as men with spirit gone;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In search of thee a hundred twice-born rove</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Over all lands.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 10.5em;'>But (O King Yudhisthir!)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hardly one word she heard before she broke</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With question after question on the man,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Asking of this dear friend and that and this;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All mingled with quick tears, and tender sighs,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And hungry gazing on her brother's friend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sud&ecirc;va&mdash;best of Br&aacute;hmanas&mdash;come there.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which soon Sunand&acirc; marked, watching them speak</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Apart, and Damayanti all in tears.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then came she to her mother, saying: &quot;See,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The handmaid thou didst give me talks below</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With one who is a Br&aacute;hman, all her words</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Watered with weeping; if thou wilt, demand</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What this man knows.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 12.5em;'>Therewith swept forth amazed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mother of the Raja, and beheld</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How Nala's wife spake with the Br&aacute;hmana.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom straight she bade them summon; and, being brought,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In this wise questioned: &quot;Knowest thou whose wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose daughter, this one is; and how she left</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her kin; and wherefore, being heavenly-eyed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And noble-mannered, she hath wandered here?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I am full fain to hear this; tell me all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No whit withholding; answer faithfully&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who is our slave-girl with the goddess gait?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The Br&aacute;hmana Sud&ecirc;va, so addressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seating himself at ease, unto the Queen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Told Damayanti's story, how all fell.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Sud&ecirc;va said: &quot;There reigns in majesty</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>King Bhima at Vidarbha; and of him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Princess Damayanti here is child;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Virasena's son, Nala, is Lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Over Nishadha, praised-in-song and wise;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And of that Prince this lady is the wife.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In play his brother worsted Nala&mdash;stripped</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of lands and wealth the Prince; who fled his realm,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wandering with Damayanti&mdash;where, none knew.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In quest of Damayanti we have roamed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The earth's face o'er, until I found her here</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In thy son's house, the King's&mdash;the very same,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Since like to her for grace no woman lives</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of all fair women. Where her eyebrows meet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A pretty mole, born with her, should be seen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A little lotus-bud&mdash;not visible</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By reason of the dust of toil which clouds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her face and veils its moon-like beauty&mdash;that</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wondrous Maker on the rare work stamped</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To be His Mark. But as the waxing moon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Goes thin and darkling for awhile, then rounds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The crescent's rims with splendors, so this Queen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hath lost not queenliness. Being now obscured,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soiled with the grime of chores, unbeautified,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She shows true gold. The fire which trieth gold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Denoteth less itself by instant heat</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Than Damayanti by her goodlihood.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As first sight knew I her. She bears that mole.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Whilst yet Sud&ecirc;va spake (O King of men!),</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sunand&acirc; from the slave's front washed away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gathered dust, and forth that mark appeared</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Twixt Damayanti's brows, as when clouds break,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And in the sky the moon, the night-maker,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Glitters to view. Seeing the spot awhile,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sunand&acirc; and the mother of the King</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gazed voiceless; then they clasped her neck and wept</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rejoicing, till the Queen, staying her tears,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Exclaimed: &quot;My sister's daughter, dear! thou art,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By this same mark. Thy mother and myself</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Were sisters by one father&mdash;he that rules</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Da&#347;arna, King Sud&acirc;man. She was given</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Bhima, and to Virabahu I.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Once at Da&#347;arna, in my father's house,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I saw thee, newly born. Thy race and mine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Princess, are one: henceforward, therefore, here</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As I am, Damayanti, shalt thou be.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>With gladdened heart did Damayanti bend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before her mother's sister, answering thus:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Peaceful and thankful dwelled I here with thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Being unknown, my every need supplied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My life and honor by thy succor safe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet, Maharajni, even than this dear home</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One would be dearer: 'tis so many days</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Since we were parted. Suffer me to go</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where those my tender little ones were led;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So long&mdash;poor babes!&mdash;of me and of their sire</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bereft. If, lady, thou dost think to show</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kindness to me, this is my wish: to wend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto Vidarbha swiftly; wilt thou bid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They bear me thither?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 13.5em;'>Was no sooner heard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That fond desire, than the queen-mother gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Willing command; and soon an ample troop,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The King consenting, gathered for her guard.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So was she sent upon a palanquin,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With soldiers, pole-bearers, and meat and drink,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And garments as befitted&mdash;happier&mdash;home.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thus to Vidarbha came its Pride again,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By no long road; and joyously her kin</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Brought the sweet Princess in, and welcomed her.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In peace and safety all her house she found;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her children well;&mdash;father and mother, friends.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gods she worshipped, and to Br&aacute;hmanas</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Due reverence made, and whatso else was meet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That Damayanti did, regal in all.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To wise Sud&ecirc;va fell the thousand cows</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Bhima granted, with the village-lands,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And goodly gifts beside.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 14.5em;'>But when there passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One night of rest within the palace-walls,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wistful Princess to her mother said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;If thou wouldst have me live, I tell thee true,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dear mother, it must be by bringing back</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Nala, my own lord; and only so.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>When this she spake, right sorrowful became</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Rani, weeping silently, nor gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One word of answer; and the palace-girls,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeing this grief, sat round them, weeping too,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And crying: &quot;Haha! where is gone her lord?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And loud the lamentation was of all.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Afterwards to the Maharaja his Queen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Told what was said: &quot;Lord! all uncomforted</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy daughter Damayanti weeps and grieves,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lacking her husband. Even to me she spake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before our damsels, laying shame aside:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Find Nala; let the people of the court</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Strive day and night to learn where Nala is.'&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then Bhima, hearing, called his Br&aacute;hmanas</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Patient and wise, and issued hest to go</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into all regions, seeking for the Prince.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But first, by mandate of the Maharaja,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Damayanti all those twice-born came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saying: &quot;Now we depart!&quot; Then Bhima's child</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gave ordinance: &quot;To whatsoever lands</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ye wend, say this&mdash;wherever gather men,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Say this&mdash;in every place these verses speak:&mdash;</span><br />

<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Whither art thou departed, cruel lover,</span><br />

<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, furthermore,&quot; the Princess said, &quot;since fire</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By shepherds' huts and hermits' caves, they passed,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Heard me thy verses say, as thou hadst said;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Great Rituparna heard those very words,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ofttimes addressed. But when I had my leave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And was withdrawn, a man accosted me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Privately&mdash;one of Rituparna's train,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vah&ucirc;ka named, the Raja's charioteer</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And tears which rolled and rolled&mdash;asked of my health,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And afterwards crept secretly and said</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto her mother: &quot;Breathe no word hereof,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dear mother, to the King, but let me speak</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nothing should Bhima know of what I plan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But, if thou lovest me, by thee and me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This shall be wrought. As I was safely led</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By good Sud&ecirc;va home, so let him go&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With not less happy fortune&mdash;to bring back,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ere many days, my Nala; let him seek</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ayodhy&acirc;, mother dear, and fetch my Prince!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But first Parn&acirc;da, resting from his road&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That best of twice-borns&mdash;did the Princess thank</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With honorable words and gifts: &quot;If home</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Nala cometh, Br&aacute;hman!&quot; so she spake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Great guerdon will I give. Thou hast well done</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For me herein&mdash;- better than any man;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Helping me find again my wandered lord.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To which fair words made soft reply, and prayers</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For &quot;peace and fortune,&quot; that high-minded one,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And so passed home, his service being wrought.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Next to Sud&ecirc;va spake the sad Princess</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This (O my King!), her mother standing by:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Good Br&aacute;hman, to Ayodhy&acirc;'s city go.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Say in the ears of Raja Rituparna,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As though thou cam'st a simple traveller,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'The daughter of King Bhima once again</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Maketh to hold her high Swayamvara.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The kings and princes from all lands repair</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thither; the time draws nigh; to-morrow's dawn</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall bring the day. If thou wouldst be of it,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Speed quickly, conquering King! at sunsetting</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Another lord she chooseth for herself;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Since whether Nala liveth or is dead,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>None knoweth.'&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 10em;'>These the words which he should say;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, learning them, he sped, and thither came&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That Br&aacute;hmana Sud&ecirc;va&mdash;and he spake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Maharaja Rituparna so.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Now when the Raja Rituparna heard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sud&ecirc;va's words, quoth he to Vah&ucirc;ka</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Full pleasantly: &quot;Much mind I have to go</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where Damayanti holds Swayamvara,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If to Vidarbha, in a single day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou deemest we might drive, my charioteer!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Of Nala, by his Raja thus addressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Torn was the heart with anguish; for he thought:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Can Damayanti purpose this? Could grief</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So change her? Is it not some fine device</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For my sake schemed? Or doth my Princess seek,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All holy as she was, this guilty joy,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Being so wronged of me, her rash weak lord?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Frail is a woman's heart, and my fault great!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus might she do it, being far from home,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bereft of friends, desolate with long woes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of love for me&mdash;my slender-waisted one!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet no, no, no! she would not&mdash;she that is</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My children's mother! Be it false or true,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Best shall I know in going; therefore now</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The will of Rituparna must I serve.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thus pondering in his mind, the troubled Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With joined palms meekly to his master said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;I shall thy hest accomplish! I can drive</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In one day, Raja, to Vidarbha's gates.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then in the royal stables&mdash;steed by steed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stallions and mares, Vah&ucirc;ka scanned them all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Rituparna prayed quickly to choose.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Slowly he picked four coursers, under-fleshed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But big of bone and sinew; fetlocked well</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For journeying; high-bred, heavy-framed; of blood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To match the best, yet gentle; blemish-free;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Broad in the jaw, with scarlet nostrils spread;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bearing the <i>Avarthas</i>, the ten true marks&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Reared on the banks of Indus, swift as wind.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which, when the Raja looked upon, he cried,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Half-wrathful: &quot;What thing thinkest thou to do?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wilt thou betray me? How should sorry beasts,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lean-ribbed and ragged, take us all that way,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The long road we must swiftly travel hence?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Vah&ucirc;ka answered: &quot;See on all these four</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The ten sure marks: one curl upon each crest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two on the cheeks, two upon either flank,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two on the breast, and on each crupper one.<a name="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a></span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These to Vidarbha&mdash;doubt it not&mdash;will go;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet, Raja, if thou wilt have others, speak;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And I shall yoke them.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 14em;'>Rituparna said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;I know thou hast deep skill in stable-craft;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yoke therefore such four coursers as thou wilt,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But quickly!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 9em;'>Thus those horses, two by two,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High-mettled, spare, and strong, Prince Nala put</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Under the bars; and when the car was hitched,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And eagerly the Raja made to mount,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At sign the coursers bent their knees, and lay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Along the earth. Then Nala (O my King!),</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With kindly voice cheering the gaunt bright steeds,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Loosed them, and grasped the reins, and bade ascend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Varshneya: so he started, headlong, forth.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>At cry of Vah&ucirc;ka the four steeds sprung</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into the air, as they would fly with him;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when the Raja felt them, fleet as wind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whirling along, mute sat he and amazed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And much Varshneya mused to hear and see</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The thundering of those wheels; the fiery four</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So lightly held; Vah&ucirc;ka's matchless art.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Is M&acirc;tali, who driveth Indra's car,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our charioteer? for all the marks of him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are here! or S&acirc;lihotra can this be,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The god of horses, knowing all their ways,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who here in mortal form his greatness hides?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or is it&mdash;can it be&mdash;Nala the Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala the steed-tamer?&quot; Thus pondered he:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Whatever Nala knew this one doth know.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Alike the mastery seems of both; alike</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I judge their years. If this man be not he,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two Nalas are there in the world for skill.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They say there wander mighty powers on earth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In strange disguises, who, divinely sprung,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Veil themselves from us under human mould;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bewilderment it brings me, this his shape</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Misshappen&mdash;from conclusion that alone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Withholds me; yet I wist not what to think,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In age and manner like&mdash;and so unlike</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In form! Else Vah&ucirc;ka I must have deemed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala, with Nala's gifts.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 15em;'>So in his heart,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Varshneya, watching, wondered&mdash;being himself</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The second charioteer. But Rituparna</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sat joyous with the speed, delightedly</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Marking the driving of the Prince: the eyes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Attent; the hand so firm upon the reins;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The skill so quiet, wise, and masterful;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Great joy the Maharaja had to see.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>By stream and mountain, woodland-path and pool,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Swiftly, like birds that skim in air, they sped;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till, as the chariot plunged, the Raja saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His shoulder-mantle falling to the ground;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And&mdash;loath to lose the robe&mdash;albeit so pressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Nala cried he, &quot;Let me take it up;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Check the swift horses, wondrous charioteer;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bid Varshneya light, and fetch my cloth,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But Nala answered: &quot;Far it lies behind;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A yojana already we have passed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We cannot turn again to pick it up.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>A little onward Riturparna saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Within the wood a tall Myrobolan</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Heavy with fruit; hereat, eager he cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Now, Vah&ucirc;ka, my skill thou mayest behold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In the Arithmic. All arts no man knows;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each hath his wisdom, but in one man's wit</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is perfect gift of one thing, and not more.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From yonder tree how many leaves and fruits,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Think'st thou, lie fall'n there upon the earth?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Just one above a thousand of the leaves,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And one above a hundred of the fruits;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And on those two limbs hang, of dancing leaves,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Five crores exact; and shouldst thou pluck yon boughs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Together with their shoots, on those twain boughs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Swing twice a thousand nuts and ninety-five!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Vah&ucirc;ka checked the chariot wonderingly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And answered: &quot;Imperceptible to me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is what thou boastest, slayer of thy foes!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But I to proof will put it, hewing down</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The tree, and, having counted, I shall know.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before thine eyes the branches twain I'll lop:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How prove thee, Maharaja, otherwise,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whether this be or be not? I will count</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One by one&mdash;fruits and leaves&mdash;before thee, King;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Varshneya, for a space, can rein the steeds.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>To him replied the Raja: &quot;Time is none</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now to delay.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 10em;'>Vah&ucirc;ka answered quick</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(His own set purpose serving): &quot;Stay this space,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or by thyself drive on! The road is good,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The son of Vrishni will be charioteer!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>On that the Raja answered soothingly:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;There is not in the earth another man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That hath thy skill; and by thy skill I look</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To reach Vidarbha, O thou steed-tamer!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou art my trust; make thou not hindrance now!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet would I suffer, too, what thou dost ask,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If thou couldst surely reach Vidarbha's gate</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before yon sun hath sunk.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 15.5em;'>Nala replied:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;When I have counted those vibh&icirc;tak boughs,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vidarbha I will reach; now keep thy word.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Ill pleased, the Raja said: &quot;Halt then, and count!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Take one bough from the branch which I shall show,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And tell its fruits, and satisfy thy soul.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So leaping from the car&mdash;eager he shore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The boughs, and counted; and all wonder-struck</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Rituparna spake: &quot;Lo, as thou saidst</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So many fruits there be upon this bough!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Exceeding marvellous is this thy gift,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I burn to know such learning, how it comes.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Answered the Raja, for his journey fain:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;My mind is quick with numbers, skilled to count;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I have the science.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 12.5em;'>&quot;Give it me, dear Lord!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vah&ucirc;ka cried: &quot;teach me, I pray, this lore,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And take from me my skill in horse-taming.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Quoth Rituparna&mdash;impatient to proceed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet of such skill desirous: &quot;Be it so!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As thou hast prayed, receive my secret art,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Exchanging with me here thy mastery</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of horses.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 8em;'>Thereupon did he impart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His rules of numbers, taking Nala's too.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But wonderful! So soon as Nala knew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That hidden gift, the accursed Kali leapt</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forth from his breast, the evil spirit's mouth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spewing the poison of Kark&ocirc;taka</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even as he issued. From the afflicted Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That bitter plague of Kali passed away;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And for a space Prince Nala lost himself,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rent by the agony. But when he saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The evil one take visible shape again&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Free from the serpent's poison&mdash;Nishadha's Lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Had thought to curse him then; but Kali stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With clasped palms trembling, and besought the Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saying: &quot;Thy wrath restrain, Sovereign of men!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I will repay thee well. Thy virtuous wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Indrasen's angered mother, laid her ban</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon me when thou didst forsake her; since</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Within thee have I dwelled in anguish sore,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tortured and tossed and burning, night and day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With venom from the great snake's fang, which passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into me by thy blood. Be pitiful!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I take my refuge in thy mercy! Hear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My promise, Prince! Wherever men henceforth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall name thee before people, praising thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This shall protect them from the dread of me;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala shall guard from Kali, if so now</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou spare to curse me, seeking grace of thee.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thus supplicated, Nala stayed his wrath,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Acceding; and the direful Kali fled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into the wounded tree, possessing it.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But of no eyes, save Nala's, was he seen,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor heard of any other; and the Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His sorrows shaking off, when Kali passed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>After that numbering of the leaves, in joy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unspeakable, and glowing with new hope,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mounted the car again, and urged his steeds.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But from that hour the tall Myrobolan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Possessed by Kali, stood there, sear and dead.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then onward, onward, speeding like the birds,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those coursers flew; and fast and faster still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The glad Prince cheered them forward, all elate:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And proudly rode the Raja towards the walls</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of high Vidarbha. Thus did journey down</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Exultant Nala, free of trouble now,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Quit of the evil spell, but bearing still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His form misshapen, and the shrunken limb.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>At sunset in Vidarbha (O great King!)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The watchers on the walls proclaimed, &quot;There comes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Raja Rituparna!&quot; Bhima bade</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Open the gates; and thus they entered in,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Making all quarters of the city shake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With rattling of the chariot-wheels. But when</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The horses of Prince Nala heard that sound,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For joy they neighed, as when of old their lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Drew nigh. And Damayanti, in her bower,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Far off that rattling of the chariot heard,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As when at time of rains is heard the voice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of clouds low thundering; and her bosom thrilled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At echo of that ringing sound. It came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Loud and more loud, like Nala's, when of old,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gripping the reins, he cheered his mares along.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>It seemed like Nala to the Princess then&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That clatter of the trampling of the hoofs;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>It seemed like Nala to the stabled steeds:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon the palace-roof the peacocks heard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And screamed; the elephants within their stalls</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Heard it and trumpeted; the coursers, tied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Snorted for joy to hear that leaping car;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Peacocks and elephants and cattle stalled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All called and clamored with uplifted heads,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As wild things do at noise of coming rain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then to herself the Princess spake: &quot;This car,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The rolling of it, echoing all around,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gladdens my heart. It must be Nala comes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My King of men! If I see not, this day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Prince that hath the bright and moon-like face,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My hero of unnumbered gifts, my lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ah, I shall die! If this day fall I not</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into his opening arms&mdash;at last, at last&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And feel his close embrace, oh, beyond doubt,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I cannot live! If&mdash;ending all&mdash;to-day</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha cometh not, with this deep sound</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like far-off thunder, then to-night I'll leap</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into the golden, flickering, fiery flames!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If now, now, now, my lion draws not nigh,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My warrior-love, like the wild elephant,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Prince of princes&mdash;I shall surely die!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nought call I now to mind he said or did</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That was not rightly said and justly done.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No idle word he spake, even in free speech;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Patient and lordly; generous to bestow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beyond all givers; scorning to be base,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yea, even in secret&mdash;such Nishadha was.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Alas! when, day and night, I think of him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How is my heart consumed, reft of its joy!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So meditating, like one torn by thoughts,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She mounted to the palace-roof to see;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thence, in the mid-court, the car beheld</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Arriving. Rituparna and Vah&ucirc;ka</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She saw, with Vrishni's son, descend and loose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The panting horses, wheeling back the car.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then Rituparna, alighting, sought the King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bhima the Maharaja, far-renowned&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom Bhima with fair courtesies received;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Since well he deemed such breathless visit made</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With deep cause, knowing not the women's plots.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;<i>Sw&acirc;gatam!&quot;</i> cried he; &quot;what hath brought thee, Prince?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For nothing wist he that the Raja came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Suitor of Damayanti. Questioned so,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This Raja Rituparna, wise and brave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seeing no kings nor princes in the court,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor noise of the Swayamvara, nor crowd</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Br&aacute;hmans gathering&mdash;weighing all those things,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Answered in this wise: &quot;I am come, great Lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To make thee salutations!&quot; But the King</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Laughed in his beard at Rituparna's word&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That this of many weary yojanas</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Should be the mark. &quot;<i>Ahoswid</i>! Hath he passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through twenty towns,&quot; thought he, &quot;and hither flown</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To bid good-morrow? Nay, it is not that.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Good! I shall know it when he bids me know.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thereat, with friendly speech his noble guest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The King to rest dismissed. &quot;Repose thyself,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He said; &quot;the road was long; weary thou art.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Rituparna, with sentences of grace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Replying to this graciousness, was led</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By slaves to the allotted sleeping-room;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And after Rituparna, Varshneya went.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vah&ucirc;ka, left alone, the chariot ran</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Into its shed, and from the foamy steeds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unbuckled all the harness, thong by thong,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Speaking soft words to them; then sat him down,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Alone, forgotten, on the driving-seat.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But Damayanti, seeing Rituparna,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Vrishni's son, and him called Vah&ucirc;ka,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spake sorrowful: &quot;Whose was the thunder, then,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of that fleet car? It seemed like Nala's own;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet here I see no Nala! Hath yon man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My lord's art learned, or th'other one, that thus</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their car should thunder as when Nala comes?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Could Rituparna drive as Nala doth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So that those chariot-wheels should sound like his?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, after having pondered (O my King!),</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The beauteous Princess sent her handmaiden</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Vah&ucirc;ka, that she might question him.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Go, Keshin&icirc;,&quot; the Princess said; &quot;inquire</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who is that man upon the driving-seat,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Misshapen, with the shrunken arm. Approach</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Composedly, question him winningly</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With greetings kind, and bid him answer thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>According to the truth. I feel at heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A doubt&mdash;a hope&mdash;that this, perchance, may be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My Lord and Prince; there is some new-born joy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fluttering within my breast. Accost him, girl;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, ere thou partest, what Parn&acirc;da said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Say thou, and hear him answer, blameless one,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bring it on thy lips!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 16em;'>Then went the maid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Demurely, and accosted Vah&ucirc;ka,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While Damayanti watched them from the roof.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;<i>Kushalam t&ecirc; brav&icirc;mi</i>&mdash;health and peace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I wish thee!&quot; said she. &quot;Wilt thou answer true</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What Damayanti asks? She sends to ask</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whence set ye forth, and wherefore are ye come</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hither? Vidarbha's Princess fain would know.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;'Twas told my Raja,&quot; Vah&ucirc;ka replied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;That Damayanti for the second turn</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Holds her Swayamvara: the Br&aacute;hman's word</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was, &quot;This shall be to-morrow.&quot; So he sped,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hearing that news, with steeds which in one day</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fly fifty yojanas, swift as the winds,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Exceeding fleet. His charioteer am I.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Who, then,&quot; Keshin&icirc; asked, &quot;is he that rode</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The third? whence cometh he, and what his race?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thou thyself whence sprung? and tell me why</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou servest thus?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 13em;'>Then Vah&ucirc;ka replied:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Varshneya is the third who rode with us,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The famous charioteer of Nala he:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When thy Prince fled, he went to Koshala</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And took our service. I in horse-taming</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And dressing meat have skill; so am I made</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>King Rituparna's driver and his cook.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Knoweth Varshneya, then, where Nala fled?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Inquired the maid; &quot;and did he tell thee this,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or what spake he?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 11em;'>&quot;Of that unhappy Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He brought the children hither, and then went</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even where he would, of Nala wotting nought;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor wotteth any man, fair damsel! more.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hidden from mortal eyes Nishadha lives,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wandering the world, his very body changed.</span><br />

<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 3em;'>'Whither art thou departed, cruel lover,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Who stole the half of thy belov&egrave;d's cloth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And left her to awaken and discover</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nay, on thy faith, when thou didst hear that man,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But, mastering his anguish, holding down</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The passion of his pain, with voice which strove</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To speak through sobs, the Prince repeated this:&mdash;</span><br />

<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Even against the ruined, rash, ungrateful,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 4em;'>Faithless, fond Prince, from whom the birds did steal</span><br />

<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Speaking these verses, woful Nala moaned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, overcome by thought, restrained no more</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His trickling tears; fast broke they forth (O King!).</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But Keshin&icirc;, returning, told his words</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Damayanti, and the grief of him.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>When Damayanti heard, sore-troubled still,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet in her heart supposing him her Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Again she spake: &quot;Go, Kashin&icirc;, and watch</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whatever this man doeth; near him stand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Holding thy peace, and mark the ways of him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all his acts, going and coming; note</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If aught there be of strange in any deed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let them not give him fire, my girl&mdash;not though</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This hindereth sore; nor water, though he ask</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even with beseeching. Afterwards observe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bring me what befalls, and every sign</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of earthly or unearthly power he shows;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And whatsoever else Vah&ucirc;ka doth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>See it, and say.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 10em;'>Thereon Keshin&icirc; sped,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Obeying Damayanti and&mdash;at hand&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whatever by that horse-tamer was wrought,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The damsel watched, and all his ways; and came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Back to the Princess, unto whom she told</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each thing Vah&ucirc;ka did, as it befell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And what the signs were, and the wondrous works</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of earthly and unearthly gifts in him.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;<i>Subh&ecirc;</i>!&quot;<a name="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> quoth she, &quot;the man is magical,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But high and holy mannered; never yet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saw I another such, nor heard of him.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Passing the low door of the inner court,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where one must stoop, he did not bow his head,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But as he came the lintel lifted up</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And gave him space. Bhima the King had sent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Many and diverse meats for Rituparna,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of beast and bird and fish&mdash;great store of food&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The which to cleanse some chatties stood hard by,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All empty; yet he did but look on them,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wishful, and lo! the water brimmed the pots.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, having washed the meats, he hastened forth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In quest of fire, and, holding towards the sun</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A knot of withered grass, the bright flame blazed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Instant amidst it. Wonderstruck was I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This miracle to see, and hither ran</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With other strangest marvels to impart:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For, Princess, when he touched the blazing grass</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He was not burned, and water flows for him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At will, or ceases flowing; and this, too,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The strangest thing of all, did I behold&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He took some faded leaves and flowers up,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And idly handled them; but while his hands</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Toyed with them, lo! they blossomed forth again</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With lovelier life than ever, and fresh scent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Straight on their stalks. These marvels have I seen,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And fly back now to tell thee, mistress dear!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But when she knew such wonders of the man,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>More certainly she deemed those acts and gifts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Betokened Nala; and so-minded, full</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of trust to find her lord in Vah&ucirc;ka,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With happier tears and softening voice she said</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Keshin&icirc;: &quot;Speed yet again, my girl;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, while he wots not, from the kitchen take</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Meat he hath dressed, and bring it here to me.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So went the maid, and, waiting secretly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Broke from the mess a morsel, hot and spiced,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, bearing it with faithful swiftness, gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Damayanti. She (O Kuru King!)&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That knew so well the dishes dressed by him&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Touched, tasted it, and, laughing&mdash;weeping&mdash;cried,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beside herself with joy: &quot;Yes, yes; 'tis he!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That charioteer is Nala!&quot; then, a-pant,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Even while she washed her mouth, she bade the maid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Go with the children twain to Vah&ucirc;ka;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who, when he saw his little Indrasen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Indrasena, started up, and ran,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And caught, and folded them upon his breast;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Holding them there, his darlings, each as fair</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As children of the gods. Then, quite undone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With love and yearning, loudly sobbed the Prince.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Until, perceiving Keshin&icirc;, who watched,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shamed to be known, he set his children down,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And said: &quot;In sooth, good friend, this lovely pair</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So like mine own are, that at seeing them</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I am surprised into these foolish tears.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou comest here too often; men will think</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thee light, or me; remember, we are here,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Strangers and guests, girl! Go thy ways in peace!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But seeing that great trouble of his soul,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lightly came Keshin&icirc;, and pictured all</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Damayanti. She, burning to know</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If truly this were Nala, bade the girl</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seek the Queen's presence, saying thus for her:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Mother! long watching Vah&ucirc;ka, I deem</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The charioteer is Nala. One doubt lives&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His altered form. I must myself have speech</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With Vah&ucirc;ka; thou, therefore, bid him come,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or suffer me to seek him. Be this done</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forthwith, good mother!&mdash;whether known or not</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unto the Maharaja.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 12em;'>When she heard,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Queen told Bhima what the Princess prayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who gave consent; and having this good leave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From father and from mother (O my King!),</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Command was sent that Vah&ucirc;ka be brought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where the court ladies lodged.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 17em;'>So met those twain;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when Prince Nala's gaze fell on his wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He stood with beating heart and tearful eyes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when sweet Damayanti looked on him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She could not speak for anguish of keen joy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To have him close; but sat there, mute and wan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wearing a sad-hued cloth, her lustrous hair</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Falling unbanded, and the mourning-mark</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stamped in gray ashes on her lovely brow.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, when she found a voice, these were the words</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That came from her: &quot;Didst ever, Vah&ucirc;ka&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If Vah&ucirc;ka thy name be, as thou say'st&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Know one of noble nature, honorable,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who in the wild woods left his wife asleep&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His innocent, fond wife&mdash;weary and worn?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Know'st thou the man. I'll say his name to thee;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Twas Nala, Raja Nala! Ah, and when</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In any thoughtless hour had I once wrought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The smallest wrong, that he should leave me so,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There in the wood, by slumber overcome?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before the gods I chose him for my lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gods themselves rejecting; tell me how</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This Prince could so abandon, in her need,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His true, his loving wife, she who did bear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His babes&mdash;abandon her to whom he swore&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My hand clasped, in the sight of all the gods,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Agni's self&mdash;'Thy true lord I will be!'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou saidst it!&mdash;where is now that promise, fled?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>While thus she spake (O Victor of thy foes!),</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fast from her eyes the woe-sprung waters ran.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Nala, seeing those night-black, loving eyes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Reddened with weeping, seeing her falling tears;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Broke forth: &quot;Ah! that I lost my throne and realm</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In dicing, was not done by fault of mine;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'T was Kali wrought it; Kali, O my wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Drove me to leave thee. Therefore, long ago</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That evil one was stricken by the curse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which thou didst utter, wandering in the wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Desolate, night and day, grieving for me.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Possessing me he dwelt; but, cursed by thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tortured he dwelt, consuming with thy words</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In fierce and fiercer pain, as when is piled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Brand upon burning brand. But he is gone;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Patience and penance have o'ermastered him.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Princess, the end is reached of our long woes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That evil one being fled, freeing my will,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>See, I am here; and wherefore would I come,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fairest, except for thee? Yet, answer this:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How should a wife, right-minded to her lord&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her own and lawful lord&mdash;compass to choose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Another love, as thou, that tremblest, didst?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy messengers over all regions ran,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By the King's name proclaiming: 'Bhima's child</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A second husband chooseth for herself,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whomso she will&mdash;as pleaseth&mdash;being free,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those shameless tidings brought the Raja here</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At headlong speed&mdash;and me!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 16.5em;'>Tenderly smiled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Damayanti through her tears, with quivering lips,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And joined palms, answering her aggriev&egrave;d Prince:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Judgest thou me guilty of such a sin?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When for thy sake I put the gods aside&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thee did I choose, Nishadha, my one lord.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In quest of thee did all those Br&aacute;hmans range</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In all ten regions, telling all one tale</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Taught them by me; and so Parn&acirc;da came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Koshala, where Rituparna dwells,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And found thee in his house, and spake to thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those words, and had thy gentle answer back.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mine the device was, Prince, to bring thee quick;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For well I wist no man in all this world</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Could in one day the fleetest coursers urge</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So many yojanas, save thou, dear Prince!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I touch thy feet, and tell thee this in truth;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And true it is that never any wrong</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Against thee, even in fancy, have I dreamed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Witness for me, as I am loyal and pure,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The ever-shifting, all-beholding Air,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who wanders o'er the earth; let him withdraw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My breath and slay me, if I sinned in aught!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Witness for me, yon golden Sun who goes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With bright eye over us; let him withhold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Warm life and kill me, if I sinned in aught!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Witness for me the white Moon, whose pale spell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lies on all flesh and spirit; let that orb</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deny me peace and end me, if I sinned!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These be the watchers and the testifiers,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The three chief gods that rule the three wide worlds;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I cry unto them; let them speak for me;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thou shalt hear them answer for my faith,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or once again, this day, abandon me.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then Vayu showed&mdash;the all-enfolding Air&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And spake: &quot;Not one wrong hath she wrought thee, Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I tell thee sooth. The treasure of her truth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Faultless and undefiled she hath kept</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By us regarded, and sustained by us,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These many days. Her tender plot it was,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Planned for thy sake, which brought thee; since who else</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Could in one day drive threescore yojanas?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala, thou hast thy noble wife again;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou, Damayanti, hast thy Nala back.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Away with doubting; take her to thy breast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thrice happy Prince!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 13em;'>And while God Vayu spake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Look! there showered flowers down out of the sky<a name="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon them; and the drums of heaven beat</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beautiful music, and a gentle wind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fragrant, propitious, floated, kissing them.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But Nala, when he saw these things befall&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wonderful, gracious&mdash;when he heard that voice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Called the great snake to memory:&mdash;whereupon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His proper self returned. Bhima's fair child</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Divinely sounding (Lord of Bh&acirc;rat's line!)&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yielded all doubt of his delightful Love.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then cast he round about his neck the cloth&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unstained by earth, enchanted&mdash;and (O King!)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saw her dear lord his beauteous form resume.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Ah, Nala! Nala!&quot; cried she, while her arms</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Clasped him and clung; and Nala to his heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pressed that bright lady, glowing, as of old,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With princely majesty. Their children twain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Next he caressed; while she&mdash;at happy peace&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her beautiful glad face laid on his breast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sighing with too much joy. And Nala stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A great space silent, gazing on her face,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sorrow-stamped yet, her long, deep-lidded eyes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her melting smile&mdash;himself 'twixt joy and woe.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Afterwards, all that story of the Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all of Damayanti, Bhima's Queen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Told to the Maharaja joyously.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Bhima said: &quot;To-morrow will I see&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When Nala hath his needful offerings made&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our daughter and this wandering lord well knit.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But all that night they sat, hand clasped in hand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rejoicing, and relating what befell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In the wild wood, and of the woful times.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>That night being spent, Prince Nala in his state</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Led forth Vidarbha's Pride before the court.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Bhima&mdash;in an hour found fortunate&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Re-wed those married lovers. Dutifully</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala paid homage to the Maharaja,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And reverently did Damayanti bow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before her father. He the Prince received</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With grace and gladness, as a son restored,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Making fair welcome, and with words of praise</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Exalting Damayanti, tried and true;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which in all dignity Prince Nala took,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Returning, as was meet, words honorable.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Therewith unto the city spread the noise</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of that rejoicing. All the townspeople,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Learning of Nala joyously returned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made all their quarters gay with float of flags,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Flutter of cloths, and garlands; sprinkled free</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The King's-ways with fresh water, and the cups</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of fragrant flowers; and hung long wreaths of flowers.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From door to door the white street-fronts before;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And decked each temple-porch, and went about</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The altar-gods.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And afterwards, in Bhima's royal house</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Serenely dwelled the Princess and the Prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each making for the other peaceful joy.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So in the fourth year Nala was rejoined</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Damayanti, comforted and free,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Restful, attained, tasting delights again.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Also the glad Princess, gaining her lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Laid sorrows by, and blossomed forth anew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As doth the laughing earth when the rain falls,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And brings her unseen, waiting wonders forth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of blade and flower and fruit. The ache was gone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The loneliness and load. Heart-full of ease,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lovelier she grew and brighter, like the moon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mounting at midnight in the cloudless blue.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 10em;'>When Rituparna heard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How Vah&ucirc;ka is Nala in disguise,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And of the meeting, right rejoiced at heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That Raja grew. And, being softly prayed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Nala favorable thought, the King</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made royal and gentle answer, with like grace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Nala met. To whom spake Rituparna:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Joy go with thee and her, happily joined.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But say, Nishadha, wrought I any jot</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wrongful to thee, whilst sojourning unknown</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Within my walls? If any word or deed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Purposed or purposeless, hath vexed thee, friend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For one and all thy pardon grant to me!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And Nala answered: &quot;Never act or word,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The smallest, Raja, lingers to excuse!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If this were otherwise, thy slave was I,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And might not question, but must pardon thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet good to me thou wert, princely and just,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And kind thou art; and friendly from this time</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deign thou to be. Happily was I lodged,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Well-tended, well-befriended in thy house;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In mine own palace never better stead.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The skill in steeds which pleased thee, that is mine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, Raja, I will give it all to thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If thou art minded.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 12.5em;'>So Nishadha gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All his great gift in horses to the King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who learned each rule approved, and ordinance;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, having all this knowledge, gave in turn</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His deepest lore of numbers and the dice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Nala, afterwards departing home</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To his own place, another charioteer</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Driving his steeds; and, Rituparna gone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Not long did Nala dwell in Bhima's town.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>When one moon he had tarried, taking leave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha to his city started forth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With chosen train. A shining car he drove;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And elephants sixteen, and fifty horse,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And footmen thirty-score came in the rear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Swiftly did Nala journey, making earth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Quake 'neath his flying car; and wrathfully</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With quick steps entered he his palace doors.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The son of Virasena, Nala, stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Once more before that gamester Pushkara!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spake he: &quot;Play yet again; much wealth is mine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And that, and all I have&mdash;yea, my Princess&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Set I for stakes: set thou this realm, and throw!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My mind is fixed a second chance to try,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where, Pushkara, we will play for all or none.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who wins his throne and treasures from a prince,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Must stand the hazard of the counter-cast&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This is the accepted law. If thou dost blench,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The next game we will play is 'life or death,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In chariot-fight; when, or of thee or me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One shall lie satisfied: 'Descended realms,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By whatsoever means, are to be sought,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The sages say, 'by whatsoever won.'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Choose, therefore, Pushkara, which way of these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall please thee; either meet me with the dice,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or with thy bow confront me in the field.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>When Pushkara this heard, lightly he smiled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Concluding victory sure; and to the Prince</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Answered, exulting: &quot;<i>Dishtya</i>! hast thou gained</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stakes for a counter-game, Nishadha, now?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'><i>Dishtya</i>! shall I have my hard-won prize,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sweet Damayanti? <i>Dishtya</i>! didst thou come</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In kissing-reach again of thy fair wife?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon, in thy new gold splendid, she shall shine</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before all men beside me, as in heaven</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On Sakra waits the loveliest Apsar&acirc;.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>See, now, I thought on thee, I looked for thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ever and ever, Prince. There is no joy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like casting in the game with such as thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when to-day I win thy blameless one&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The smooth-limbed Damayanti&mdash;then shall be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What was to be: and I can rest content,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For always in my heart her beauty burns.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Listening the idle talk that babbler poured,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Angry Prince Nala fain had lopped away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His head with vengeful <i>khudga;</i><a name="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> but, unmoved,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Albeit the wrath blazed in his bloodshot eyes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He made reply: &quot;Play! mock me not with jests;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou wilt not jest when I have cast with thee!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So was the game set, and the Princes threw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala and Pushkara, and&mdash;the numbers named&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Nala was the hazard gained: he swept</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His brother's stake, gems, treasure, kingdom, off;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At one stroke all that mighty venture won.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then quoth the conquering Prince to Pushkara,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scornfully smiling: &quot;Mine is now once more</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nishadha's throne; mine is the realm again,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Its curse plucked forth; Vidarbha's glory thou,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Outcast, shalt ne'er so much as look upon!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fool! who to-day becom'st her bond and slave.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Not by thy gifts that evil stroke was wrought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wherefrom I fled before; 'twas Kali's spell&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Albeit thou knew'st nought, fool&mdash;overmastered me;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet will I visit not in wrathful wise</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My wrong on thee; live as thou wilt; I grant</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wherewith to live, and set apart henceforth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy proper goods and substance, and fit food.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nay, doubt not I shall show thee favor, too,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And be in friendship with thee, if thou wilt,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who art my brother. Peace abide with thee!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thus all-victorious Nala comforted</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His brother, and embraced him, sending him</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In honor to his town; and Pushkara&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gently entreated&mdash;to Nishadha spake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With folded palms and humbled face, these words:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Unending be thy glory. May thy bliss</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Last and increase for twice five thousand years,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who grantest me wherewith to live, just Lord!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And where to dwell.&quot; Thereafter, well bested,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pushkara sojourned with the Prince one moon;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So to his town departed&mdash;heart-content&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With slaves and foot-soldiers and followers,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gay as a rising sun (O Bh&acirc;rat's glory!).</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus sent he Pushkara, rich and safe, away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, with flags and drums and jewels, robed and royally arrayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala into fair Nishadha entry high and dazzling made;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At the gates the Raja, halting, spake his people words of love;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gathered were they from the city, gathered from the field and grove;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From the mountain and the maidan, all a-thrill with joy to see</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nala come to guard his children. &quot;Happy now our days will be,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Said the townsfolk, said the elders, said the villagers, &quot;O King!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Standing all with palms upfolded: &quot;Peace and fortune thou wilt bring</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To thy city, to thy country! Boundless welcome do we give,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As the gods in heaven to Indra, when with them he comes to live.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>After, when the show was ended, and the city, calm and glad,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rest from tumult of rejoicing and rich flood of feasting had,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Girt with shining squadrons, Nala fetched his pearl of women home.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like a queen did Damayanti back unto her palace come,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By the Maharaja Bhima, by that mighty monarch sent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Royally, with countless blessings, to her kingdom, in content.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There, beside his peerless Princess, and his children, bore he sway,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Godlike, even as Indra ruling 'mid the bliss of Nandana.<a name="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a></span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bore he sway&mdash;my noble Nala&mdash;princeliest of all lords&mdash;who reign</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In the lands of Jambudwipa;<a name="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> winning power and fame again;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ruling well his realm reconquered, like a just and perfect king,</span><br />

<a name='THE_RAMAYANA'></a><h2>SELECTIONS FROM THE R&Aacute;M&Aacute;YANA</h2>

<h4>BY</h4>

<h3>V&Aacute;LM&Iacute;KI</h3>
<br />

<h4>[<i>Metrical translation by R.T.H. Griffiths</i>]</h4>
<br />

<a name='SFR_INTRODUCTION'></a><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<br />

<p>The ideas of the human family are few, as is apparent from the study of
the literature of widely different nations. Thus the &quot;R&aacute;m&aacute;yana&quot; ranks in
Hindoo with the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; in Greek literature. The
character of R&aacute;ma corresponds with that of Menelaus, for both the
European and the Asiatic heroes have had their wives carried off from
them&mdash;although S&iacute;t&aacute;, the bride of R&aacute;ma, is chaste as an icicle from
Diana's temple, while Helen is the infamous type of wanton wives,
ancient and modern. The Hindoo Lanka is Troy, and Ayodhy&aacute; is Sparta. The
material civilization of the cities in the Hindoo epic is more luxurious
and gorgeous than that which Homer attributes to Greece in the heroic
age. Such splendor and refinement as invests social life at Lanka and
Ayodhy&aacute; never appear amid the severe simplicity of Argos or Troy. The
moral tone seems perhaps higher in India than in Greece during the
periods described in their several epics&mdash;at least as far as mutual love
and forbearance go&mdash;and the ideas of marriage and conjugal fidelity are
equally exalted.</p>

<p>As to the literary quality of the Hindoo epic in comparison with Homer's
work, we are at once impressed with the immense superiority of the Greek
poem in artistic proportion, point, and precision. The Hindoo poet
flounders along, amid a maze of prolix description and wearisome simile.
Trifles are amplified and repeated, and the whole poem resembles a wild
forest abounding in rich tropical vegetation, palms and flowers, but
without paths, roads, or limits. Or rather, we are reminded of one of
the highly painted and richly decorated idols of India, with their many
heads and many hands: but when we turn to the Greek epic we stand before
a statue of pure outline, flawless proportions, and more than human
beauty.</p>

<p>It is difficult to fix the date of the &quot;R&aacute;m&aacute;yana.&quot; Scholars generally
agree that it belongs to the third century before Christ, in its
original form, but that some recent portions were added even during the
Christian era. It is reckoned as one of the sacred books, and the study
of it is supposed to bring forgiveness of sin, and prosperity. Its
author is thought to have been the famous poet V&aacute;lm&iacute;ki, but the work has
evidently been rehandled several times, and there are three versions of
the poems still extant. The poem consists of twenty-four thousand
verses, and the story of it&mdash;now overlaid as it is with extravagant and
fabulous accretions&mdash;is evidently founded on fact. The scene of the poem
is laid in the city of Ayodhy&aacute;, the modern Oudh, which is described in
glowing colors as a place of health, beauty, and prosperity&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;In by-gone ages built and planned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By sainted Manu's princely hand.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>In the splendid palace of the Rajah, at Oudh, lives Da&#347;aratha, mourning
in childlessness. He is one of the princes descended from the sun, and
his line now threatens to become extinct. He determines to appeal to the
Gods by the Asva-medha, the great sacrifice in which a horse is the
victim. The rites accordingly are performed with unparalleled
magnificence, and, at the close of the ceremony, the high priest
declares to the king&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Four sons, O Monarch, shall be thine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upholders of the royal line.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>Among the offspring duly granted to Da&#347;aratha is R&aacute;ma, who is a typical
Hindoo of the heroic type. His fair wife, S&iacute;t&aacute;, is carried off by the
demon Ravana, who had assumed the form of a humble priest, or ascetic,
in order to gain access to her. He carries her in his chariot to Lanka,
the fair city built on an island of the sea. By the assistance of a
large army of monkeys, R&aacute;ma marches against Lanka, and when they stand
helpless&mdash;for the water separates them from Ceylon&mdash;he then invokes the
goddess of the sea, as Achilles did Thetis, and she comes in radiant
beauty, telling them how to bridge the waves. The monkeys bring timber
and stones, the bridge is built, Lanka reached, and the battle begins.
Indra sends his own chariot down from heaven to R&aacute;ma, who mounts it, and
vanquishes Ravana in single combat, upon which S&iacute;t&aacute; is restored to her
husband. E.W.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In whom alone these virtues dwell.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From old Ikshv&aacute;ku's line he came,</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By chains of duty firmly tied,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then Lakshman's truth was nobly shown,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then were his love and courage known,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When for his brother's sake he dared</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All perils, and his exile shared.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Loved even as he loved his life,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom happy marks combined to bless,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A miracle of loveliness,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Janak's royal lineage sprung,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where Gang&aacute;'s holy waters flow,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And R&aacute;ma there, with Lakshman's aid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A pleasant little cottage made,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And spent his days with S&iacute;t&aacute;, dressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In coat of bark and deerskin vest.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Chitrak&uacute;ta grew to be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As bright with those illustrious three</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As Meru's sacred peaks that shine</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With glory, when the Gods recline</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beneath them: &#346;iva's self between</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The aged King for R&aacute;ma pined,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though urged by all the twice-born train.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forth to the woods he fared to meet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His brother, fell before his feet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And cried &quot;Thy claim all men allow:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O come, our lord and King be thou.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But R&aacute;ma nobly chose to be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Observant of his sire's decree.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He placed his sandals in his hand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A pledge that he would rule the land:&mdash;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He ruled the realm with watchful care,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still longing eagerly to learn</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tidings of R&aacute;ma's safe return.</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then lest the people should repeat</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beneath the shady trees he stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Dandak&aacute;'s primeval wood.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vir&aacute;dha, giant fiend, he slew,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Counselled by him he gained the sword</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bow of Indra, heavenly lord:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A pair of quivers too, that bore</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A guardian God to help and save.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And R&aacute;ma's falchion left its trace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deep cut on S&uacute;rpanakh&aacute;'s face:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A hideous giantess who came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Burning for him with lawless flame.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their sister's cries the giants heard,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And vengeance in each bosom stirred;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The monster of the triple head,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And D&uacute;shan to the contest sped.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But they and myriad fiends beside</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When R&aacute;van, dreaded warrior, knew</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He bade the fiend M&aacute;r&iacute;cha aid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The vengeful plot his fury laid.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In vain the wise M&aacute;r&iacute;cha tried</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To turn him from his course aside:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Not R&aacute;van's self, he said, might hope</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With R&aacute;ma and his strength to cope.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Impelled by fate and blind with rage</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He came to R&aacute;ma's hermitage.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There, by M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's magic art,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He wiled the princely youths apart,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The vulture slew, and bore away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wife of R&aacute;ma as his prey.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The son of Raghu came and found</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He rushed within his leafy cot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He sought his wife, but found her not.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, then the hero's senses failed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In mad despair he wept and wailed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon the pile that bird he laid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And still in quest of S&iacute;t&aacute; strayed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A hideous giant then he saw,</span><br />

<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The monstrous fiend he smote and slew,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In lovely form Kabandha came,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By counsel of this saintly dame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Pamp&aacute;'s pleasant flood he came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And there the steadfast friendship won</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Hanum&aacute;n the Wind-God's son.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Counselled by him he told his grief</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To great Sugr&iacute;va, V&aacute;nar chief,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who, knowing all the tale, before</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The sacred flame alliance swore.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sugr&iacute;va to his new-found friend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Told his own story to the end:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His hate of B&aacute;li for the wrong</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And insult he had borne so long.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And R&aacute;ma lent a willing ear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And promised to allay his fear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sugr&iacute;va warned him of the might</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of B&aacute;li, matchless in the fight,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, credence for his tale to gain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Showed the huge fiend by B&aacute;li slain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The prostrate corse of mountain size</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seemed nothing in the hero's eyes;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He lightly kicked it, as it lay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And cast it twenty leagues away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To prove his might his arrows through</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seven palms in line, uninjured, flew.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He cleft a mighty hill apart,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And down to hell he hurled his dart.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then high Sugr&iacute;va's spirit rose,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Assured of conquest o'er his foes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With his new champion by his side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To vast Kishkindh&aacute;'s cave he hied.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, summoned by his awful shout,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>King B&aacute;li came in fury out,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>First comforted his trembling wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then sought Sugr&iacute;va in the strife.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One shaft from R&aacute;ma's deadly bow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The monarch in the dust laid low.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma bade Sugr&iacute;va reign</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In place of royal B&aacute;li slain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then speedy envoys hurried forth</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tidings of R&aacute;ma's spouse to bring.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Brave Hanum&aacute;n, who mocked at dread,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sprang at one wild tremendous leap</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two hundred leagues, across the deep.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Lank&aacute;'s<a name="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> town he urged his way,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He found poor S&iacute;t&aacute;, R&aacute;ma's spouse.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He gave the hapless girl a ring,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A pledge from her fair hand he bore;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then battered down the garden door.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Five captains of the host he slew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seven sons of councillors o'erthrew;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Crushed youthful Aksha on the field,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then to his captors chose to yield.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon from their bonds his limbs were free,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But honoring the high decree</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which Brahm&aacute; had pronounced of yore,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He calmly all their insults bore.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The town he burnt with hostile flame,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And spoke again with R&aacute;ma's dame,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But S&iacute;t&aacute;, touched with noble ire,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gave her fair body to the fire.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the high mandate of his sire.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Led by the Lord who rules the sky,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Met by his faithful brothers there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He loosed his votive coil of hair;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thence fair Ayodhy&aacute;'s town he gained,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And o'er his father's kingdom reigned.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They feared not storm or robber's hand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No fire or flood laid waste the land:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Golden Age seemed come again</span><br />

<h4>THE KING</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There reigned a King of name revered,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To country and to town endeared,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Great Da&#347;aratha, good and sage,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Well read in Scripture's holy page:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon his kingdom's weal intent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mighty and brave and provident;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The pride of old Ikshv&aacute;ku's seed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For lofty thought and righteous deed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Peer of the saints, for virtues famed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For foes subdued and passions tamed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A rival in his wealth untold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Indra and the Lord of Gold.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like Manu first of kings, he reigned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And worthily his state maintained.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For firm and just and ever true</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Love, duty, gain, he kept in view,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And ruled his city rich and free,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like Indra's Amar&aacute;vat&iacute;.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And worthy of so fair a place</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There dwelt a just and happy race</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With troops of children blest.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each man contented sought no more,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor longed with envy for the store</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By richer friends possessed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For poverty was there unknown,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And each man counted as his own</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kine, steeds, and gold, and grain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All dressed in raiment bright and clean,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And every townsman might be seen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With ear-rings, wreath or chain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>None deigned to feed on broken fare,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And none was false or stingy there.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A piece of gold, the smallest pay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was earned by labor for a day.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On every arm were bracelets worn,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And none was faithless or forsworn,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A braggart or unkind.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>None lived upon another's wealth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>None pined with dread or broken health,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or dark disease of mind.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High-souled were all. The slanderous word,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The boastful lie, were never heard.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each man was constant to his vows,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And lived devoted to his spouse.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No other love his fancy knew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And she was tender, kind, and true.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her dames were fair of form and face,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With charm of wit and gentle grace,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With modest raiment simply neat,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And winning manners soft and sweet.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The twice-born sages, whose delight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was Scripture's page and holy rite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their calm and settled course pursued,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor sought the menial multitude.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In many a Scripture each was versed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And each the flame of worship nursed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And gave with lavish hand.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each paid to Heaven the offerings due,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And none was godless or untrue</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In all that holy band.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Br&aacute;hmans, as the laws ordain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Warrior caste were ever fain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The reverence due to pay;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And these the Vai&#347;yas' peaceful crowd,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who trade and toil for gain, were proud</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To honor and obey;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all were by the S&uacute;dras served,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who never from their duty swerved.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their proper worship all addressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Br&aacute;hman, spirits, God, and guest.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pure and unmixt their rites remained,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their race's honor ne'er was stained.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Cheered by his grandsons, sons, and wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each passed a long and happy life.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus was that famous city held</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By one who all his race excelled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Blest in his gentle reign,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As the whole land aforetime swayed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Manu, prince of men, obeyed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her king from main to main.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And heroes kept her, strong and brave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As lions guard their mountain cave;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fierce as devouring flame they burned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And fought till death, but never turned.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Horses had she of noblest breed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like Indra's for their form and speed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From V&aacute;hli's hills and Sindhu's sand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Van&aacute;yu and K&aacute;mboja's land.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her noble elephants had strayed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through Vindhyan and Him&aacute;layan shade,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gigantic in their bulk and height,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet gentle in their matchless might.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They rivalled well the world-spread fame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the great stock from which they came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of V&aacute;man, vast of size,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Mah&aacute;padma's glorious line,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thine, Anjan, and, Air&aacute;vat, thine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upholders of the skies.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With those, enrolled in fourfold class,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who all their mighty kin surpass,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom men Matangas name,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Mrigas spotted black and white,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Bhadras of unwearied might,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Mandras hard to tame.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus, worthy of the name she bore,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ayodhy&aacute; for a league or more</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Cast a bright glory round,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where Da&#347;aratha wise and great</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Governed his fair ancestral state,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With every virtue crowned.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like Indra in the skies he reigned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In that good town whose wall contained</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High domes and turrets proud,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With gates and arcs of triumph decked,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sturdy barriers to protect</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her gay and countless crowd.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Most active and benevolent;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As sits the Vasus round their King,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Well skilled in business, fair and just,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They gained the people's love and trust,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bound in sweet friendship each to each,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They spoke kind thoughts in gentle speech.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To hide their counsel or disclose.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In foreign lands or in their own</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whatever passed, to them was known.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By secret spies they timely knew</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Skilled in the grounds of war and peace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They saw the monarch's state increase,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Watching his weal with conquering eye</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That never let occasion by,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While nature lent her aid to bless</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their labors with unbought success.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Never for anger, lust, or gain,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor are ye blind to things below:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Declare, O holy men, the way</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This plague to expiate and stay.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those best of Br&aacute;hmans shall reply:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;By every art, O Monarch, try,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hither to bring Vibh&aacute;ndak's child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Persuaded, captured, or beguiled.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when the boy is hither led</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But how to bring that wondrous boy</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bid his priests and servants bring</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With honor saintly Rishya&#347;ring.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But when they hear the monarch's speech,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All these their master will beseech,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With trembling hearts and looks of woe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To spare them, for they fear to go.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And many a plan will they declare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And crafty plots will frame,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And promise fair to show him there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unforced, with none to blame.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On every word his lords shall say,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then this shall be the plan agreed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That damsels shall be sent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Attired in holy hermits' weed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And skilled in blandishment,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That they the hermit may beguile</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With every art and amorous wile</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose use they know so well,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And by their witcheries seduce</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The unsuspecting young recluse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To leave his father's cell.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then when the boy with willing feet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall wander from his calm retreat</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And in that city stand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The troubles of the King shall end,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And streams of blessed rain descend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon the thirsty land.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus shall the holy Rishya&#347;ring</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He, at the Offering of the Steed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The flames with holy oil shall feed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And for King Da&#347;aratha gain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sons whom his prayers have begged in vain,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I have repeated, sire, thus far,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Amid the crowd of holy men.&quot;</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wise Sumantra, thus addressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unfolded at the King's behest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The plan the lords in council laid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To draw the hermit from the shade.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The priest, amid the lordly crowd,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Lomap&aacute;d thus spoke aloud:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Hear, King, the plot our thoughts have framed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A harmless trick by all unblamed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Far from the world that hermit's child</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lives lonely in the distant wild:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A stranger to the joys of sense,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His bliss is pain and abstinence;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all unknown are women yet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To him, a holy anchoret.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gentle passions we will wake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That with resistless influence shake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hearts of men; and he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Drawn by enchantment strong and sweet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall follow from his lone retreat,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And come and visit thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let ships be formed with utmost care</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That artificial trees may bear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sweet fruit deftly made;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let goodly raiment, rich and rare,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And flowers, and many a bird be there</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beneath the leafy shade.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon the ships thus decked a band</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of young and lovely girls shall stand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rich in each charm that wakes desire,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And eyes that burn with amorous fire;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Well skilled to sing, and play, and dance,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And ply their trade with smile and glance.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let these, attired in hermits' dress,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Betake them to the wilderness,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bring the boy of life austere</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A voluntary captive here,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He ended; and the King agreed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By the priest's counsel won,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all the ministers took heed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To see his bidding done.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In ships with wondrous art prepared</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Away the lovely women fared,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And soon beneath the shade they stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the wild, lonely, dreary wood.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And there the leafy cot they found</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where dwelt the devotee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And looked with eager eyes around</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermit's son to see.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still, of Vibh&aacute;ndak sore afraid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They hid behind the creeper's shade.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But when by careful watch they knew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The elder saint was far from view,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With bolder steps they ventured nigh</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To catch the youthful hermit's eye.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then all the damsels blithe and gay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At various games began to play.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They tossed the flying ball about</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With dance and song and merry shout,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And moved, their scented tresses bound</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With wreaths, in mazy motions round.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Some girls as if by love possessed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sank to the earth in feigned unrest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Up-starting quickly to pursue</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their intermitted game anew.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>It was a lovely sight to see</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those fair ones, as they played,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While fragrant robes were floating free,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bracelets clashing in their glee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A pleasant tinkling made.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The anklet's chime, the Ko&iuml;l's cry</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With music filled the place,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As 'twere some city in the sky;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which heavenly minstrels grace.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With each voluptuous art they strove</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To win the tenant of the grove,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with their graceful forms inspire</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His modest soul with soft desire.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With arch of brow, with beck and smile,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With every passion-waking wile</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of glance and lotus hand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With all enticements that excite</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The longing for unknown delight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which boys in vain withstand.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forth came the hermit's son to view</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wondrous sight to him so new,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And gazed in rapt surprise</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For from his natal hour till then</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On woman or the sons of men</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He ne'er had cast his eyes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He saw them with their waists so slim,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With fairest shape and faultless limb,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In variegated robes arrayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sweetly singing as they played.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Near and more near the hermit drew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And watched them at their game,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And stronger still the impulse grew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To question whence they came.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They marked the young ascetic gaze</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With curious eye and wild amaze,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sweet the long-eyed damsels sang,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And shrill their merry laughter rang.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then came they nearer to his side,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And languishing with passion cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Whose son, O youth, and who art thou,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Come suddenly to join us now?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And why dost thou all lonely dwell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In the wild wood? We pray thee, tell.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We wish to know thee, gentle youth;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Come, tell us, if thou wilt, the truth,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He gazed upon that sight he ne'er</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Had seen before, of girls so fair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And out of love a longing rose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His sire and lineage to disclose:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;My father,&quot; thus he made reply,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Is Ka&#347;yap's son, a saint most high,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vibh&aacute;ndak styled; from him I came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Rishya&#347;ring he calls my name.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our hermit cot is near this place:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Come thither, O ye fair of face;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There be it mine, with honor due,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ye gentle youths, to welcome you.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They heard his speech, and gave consent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And gladly to his cottage went.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vibh&aacute;ndak's son received them well</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beneath the shelter of his cell&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With guest-gift, water for their feet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And woodland fruit and roots to eat.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They smiled and spoke sweet words like these.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Delighted with his courtesies:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;We too have goodly fruit in store,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Grown on the trees that shade our door;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Come, if thou wilt, kind Hermit, haste</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The produce of our grove to taste;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And let, O good Ascetic, first</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This holy water quench thy thirst.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They spoke, and gave him comfits sweet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Prepared ripe fruits to counterfeit;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And many a dainty cate beside,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And luscious mead their stores supplied.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The seeming fruits, in taste and look,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The unsuspecting hermit took,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For, strange to him, their form beguiled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The dweller in the lonely wild.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then round his neck fair arms were flung,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And there the laughing damsels clung,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And pressing nearer and more near</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With sweet lips whispered at his ear;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While rounded limb and swelling breast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The youthful hermit softly pressed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The pleasing charm of that strange bowl,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The touch of a tender limb,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Over his yielding spirit stole</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sweetly vanquished him&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But vows, they said, must now be paid;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They bade the boy farewell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And of the aged saint afraid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Prepared to leave the dell.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With ready guile they told him where</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their hermit dwelling lay;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, lest the sire should find them there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sped by wild paths away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They fled and left him there alone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By longing love possessed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with a heart no more his own</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He roamed about distressed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The aged saint came home, to find</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermit boy distraught,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Revolving in his troubled mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One solitary thought.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Why dost thou not, my son,&quot; he cried,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Thy due obeisance pay?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Why do I see thee in the tide</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of whelming thought to-day?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A devotee should never wear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A mien so sad and strange.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Come, quickly, dearest child, declare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The reason of the change.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Rishya&#347;ring, when questioned thus,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made answer in this wise:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;O sire, there came to visit us</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Some men with lovely eyes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>About my neck soft arms they wound</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And kept me tightly held</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To tender breasts so soft and round,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That strangely heaved and swelled.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They sing more sweetly as they dance</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Than e'er I heard till now,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And play with many a sidelong glance</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And arching of the brow.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;My son,&quot; said he, &quot;thus giants roam</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where holy hermits are,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And wander round their peaceful home</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their rites austere to mar.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I charge thee, thou must never lay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy trust in them, dear boy:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They seek thee only to betray,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And woo but to destroy.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus having warned him of his foes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That night at home he spent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when the morrow's sun arose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forth to the forest went.</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But Rishya&#347;ring with eager pace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sped forth and hurried to the place</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of dainty waist and charming mien.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When from afar they saw the son</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Saint Vibh&aacute;ndak toward them run,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To meet the hermit boy they hied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And hailed him with a smile, and cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;O come, we pray, dear lord, behold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our lovely home of which we told:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Due honor there to thee we'll pay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And speed thee on thy homeward way.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pleased with the gracious words they said</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He followed where the damsels led.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As with his guides his steps he bent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That Br&aacute;hman high of worth,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And damsels trained to dance and sing.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then to the learned men he said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In many a page of Scripture read:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Be yours each rite performed to see</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>According to the King's decree.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And stranger Br&aacute;hmans quickly call</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To this great rite that welcomes all.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pavilions for the princes, decked</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With art and ornament, erect,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And handsome booths by thousands made</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Br&aacute;hman visitors to shade&mdash;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With meat and drink and all supplied.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And ample stables we shall need</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For many an elephant and steed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And chambers where the men may lie,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And vast apartments, broad and high,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fit to receive the countless bands</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of warriors come from distant lands.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For our own people too provide</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sufficient tents, extended wide,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And stores of meat and drink prepare,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all that can be needed there.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And food in plenty must be found</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For guests from all the country round.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of various viands presents make,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For honor, not for pity's sake,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That fit regard and worship be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Paid to each caste in due degree.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And let not wish or wrath excite</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Your hearts the meanest guest to slight;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But still observe with special grace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those who obtain the foremost place,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whether for happier skill in art</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or bearing in the rite their part</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Do you, I pray, with friendly mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Perform the task to you assigned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And work the rite, as bids the law,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Without omission, slip, or flaw.&quot;</span><br />

<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They answered: &quot;As thou seest fit</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In countless thousands summon all.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where'er their home be, far or near,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gather the good with honor here.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Janak, whose imperial sway</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>King Da&#347;aratha's old ally.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In length of days our monarch's peer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Illustrious King, invite him here.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The father of our ruler's bride,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Known for his virtues far and wide,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The King whom Kekaya's realms obey,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Him with his son invite, I pray.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Lomap&aacute;d, the Angas King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>True to his vows and godlike, bring.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Far be thine invitations sent</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In friendship's bonds with us allied:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Invite them all to hasten in</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With retinue and kith and kin.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Va&#347;ishtha's speech without delay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sumantra bent him to obey,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sent his trusty envoys forth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Eastward and westward, south and north.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Obedient to the saint's request</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Himself he hurried forth, and pressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each nobler chief and lord and king</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To hasten to the gathering.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before the saint Va&#347;ishtha stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All those who wrought with stone and wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And showed the work which every one</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In furtherance of the rite had done.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rejoiced their ready zeal to see,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus to the craftsmen all said he:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;I charge ye, masters, see to this,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That there be nothing done amiss.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And this, I pray, in mind be borne,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That not one gift ye give in scorn;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whenever scorn a gift attends</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Great sin is his who thus offends.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And now some days and nights had passed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Kings began to gather fast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And precious gems in liberal store</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As gifts to Da&#347;aratha bore.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then joy thrilled through Va&#347;ishtha's breast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As thus the monarch he addressed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Obedient to thy high decree</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Kings, my lord, are come to thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And it has been my care to greet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And honor all with reverence meet.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy servants' task is ended quite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all is ready for the rite.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Come forth then to the sacred ground</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where all in order will be found.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then Rishya&#347;ring confirmed the tale:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor did their words to move him fail.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The stars propitious influence lent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When forth the world's great ruler went.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then by the sage Va&#347;ishtha led,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The priest began to speed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those glorious rites wherein is shed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The lifeblood of the steed.</span><br />

<h4>THE SACRIFICE FINISHED</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The circling year had filled its course,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And back was brought the wandering horse:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then upon Sarj&uacute;'s northern strand</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Began the rite the King had planned.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With Rishya&#347;ring the forms to guide,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Br&aacute;hmans to their task applied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At that great offering of the steed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their lofty-minded King decreed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The priests, who all the Scripture knew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Performed their part in order due,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And circled round in solemn train</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As precepts of the law ordain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pravargya rites were duly sped:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For Upasads the flames were fed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then from the plant the juice was squeezed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And those high saints, with minds well pleased,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Performed the mystic rites begun</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With bathing ere the rise of sun.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They gave the portion, Indra's claim,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And hymned the King whom none can blame.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mid-day bathing followed next,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Observed as bids the holy text.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then the good priests with utmost care,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In form that Scripture's rules declare,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For the third time pure water shed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On high-souled Da&#347;aratha's head.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then Rishya&#347;ring and all the rest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Indra and the Gods addressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their sweet-toned hymn of praise and prayer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And called them in the rite to share.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With sweetest song and hymn intoned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They gave the Gods in heaven enthroned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As duty bids, the gifts they claim,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The holy oil that feeds the flame.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And many an offering there was paid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And not one slip in all was made.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For with most careful heed they saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That all was done by Veda law.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>None, all those days, was seen oppressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By hunger or by toil distressed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Why speak of human kind? No beast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was there that lacked an ample feast.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For there was store for all who came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For orphan child and lonely dame;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The old and young were well supplied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The poor and hungry satisfied.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Throughout the day ascetics fed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And those who roam to beg their bread:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While all around the cry was still,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Give forth, give forth,&quot; and &quot;Eat your fill.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Give forth with liberal hand the meal,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And various robes in largess deal.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Urged by these cries on every side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unweariedly their task they plied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And heaps of food like hills in size</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In boundless plenty met the eyes:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And lakes of sauce, each day renewed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Refreshed the weary multitude.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And strangers there from distant lands,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And women folk in crowded bands</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The best of food and drink obtained</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At the great rite the King ordained.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Apart from all, the Br&aacute;hmans there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thousands on thousands, took their share</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of various dainties sweet to taste,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On plates of gold and silver placed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All ready set, as, when they willed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The twice-born men their places filled.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And servants in fair garments dressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Waited upon each Br&aacute;hman guest.</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of cheerful mind and mien were they,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With gold and jewelled ear-rings gay.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The best of Br&aacute;hmans praised the fare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of countless sorts, of flavor rare&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus to Raghu's son they cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;We bless thee, and are satisfied.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Between the rites some Br&aacute;hmans spent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The time in learned argument,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With ready flow of speech, sedate,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And keen to vanquish in debate.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There day by day the holy train</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Performed all rites as rules ordain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No priest in all that host was found</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But kept the vows that held him bound;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>None, but the holy Vedas knew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all their sixfold science too.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No Br&aacute;hman there was found unfit</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To speak with eloquence and wit.</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And now the appointed time came near</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The sacrificial posts to rear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They brought them, and prepared to fix</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Bel and Kh&aacute;dir six and six;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Six, made of the Pal&aacute;&#347;a-tree,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Fig-wood one, apart to be&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Sleshm&aacute;t and of Devad&aacute;r</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One column each, the mightiest far:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So thick the two the arms of man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their ample girth would fail to span.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All these with utmost care were wrought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By hand of priests in Scripture taught,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all with gold were gilded bright</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To add new splendor to the rite;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Twenty-and-one those stakes in all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each one-and-twenty cubits tall:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And one-and-twenty ribbons there</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hung on the pillars bright and fair.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Firm in the earth they stood at last,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where cunning craftsmen fixed them fast;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And there unshaken each remained,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Octagonal and smoothly planed.</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then ribbons over all were hung,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And flowers and scent around them flung.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus decked they cast a glory forth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like the great saints who star the north.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The sacrificial altar then</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was raised by skilful twice-born men&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In shape and figure to behold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>An eagle with his wings of gold,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With twice nine pits and formed threefold.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each for some special God, beside</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The pillars were the victims tied;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The birds that roam the wood, the air,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The water, and the land were there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And snakes and things of reptile birth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And healing herbs that spring from earth:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As texts prescribe, in Scripture found,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Three hundred victims there were bound.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The steed devoted to the host</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Gods, the gem they honor most,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was duly sprinkled. Then the Queen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kau&#347;aly&aacute;, with delighted mien,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With reverent steps around him paced,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with sweet wreaths the victim graced;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then with three swords in order due</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She smote the steed with joy, and slew.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That night the queen, a son to gain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With calm and steady heart was fain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By the dead charger's side to stay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From evening till the break of day.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then came three priests, their care to lead</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The other queens to touch the steed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon Kau&#347;aly&aacute; to attend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their company and aid to lend.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As by the horse she still reclined,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With happy mien and cheerful mind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With Rishya&#347;ring the twice-born came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And praised and blessed the royal dame.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The priest who well his duty knew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And every sense could well subdue,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From out the bony chambers freed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And boiled the marrow of the steed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Above the steam the monarch bent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, as he smelt the fragrant scent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In time and order drove afar</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All error, that his hopes could mar.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then sixteen priests together came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And cast into the sacred flame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The severed members of the horse,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made ready all in ordered course.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On piles of holy Fig-tree raised</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The meaner victims' bodies blazed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The steed, of all the creatures slain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Alone required a pile of cane.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Three days, as is by law decreed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lasted that Offering of the Steed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Chatushtom began the rite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when the sun renewed his light,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Ukthya followed&mdash;after came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Atir&aacute;tra's holy flame.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These were the rites, and many more,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Arranged by light of holy lore,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Aptory&aacute;m of mighty power,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, each performed in proper hour,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Abhijit and Vi&#347;vajit</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With every form and service fit;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with the sacrifice at night</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Jyotishtom and &Aacute;yus rite.</span><br />
</div>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;This genial nectar take and quaff,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He spoke, and gave the lady half.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Part of the nectar that remained</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sumitr&aacute; from his hand obtained.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He gave, to make her fruitful too,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kaikey&iacute; half the residue.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A portion yet remaining there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He paused awhile to think,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then gave Sumitr&aacute;, with her share,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The remnant of the drink.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus on each queen of those fair three</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A part the King bestowed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with sweet hope a child to see</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their yearning bosoms glowed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The heavenly bowl the King supplied</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their longing souls relieved,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And soon, with rapture and with pride,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each royal dame conceived.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He gazed upon each lady's face,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And triumphed as he gazed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As Indra in his royal place</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Gods and spirits praised.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So were the sylvan chieftains formed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thousands on thousands still they swarmed.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then by the bears' great monarch stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The other roamers of the wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And turned, their pathless homes to seek,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To forest and to mountain peak.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The leaders of the monkey band</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sugr&iacute;va, offspring of the Sun,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And B&aacute;li, Indra's mighty one.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They both endowed with Garud's might,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And skilled in all the arts of fight,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wandered in arms the forest through,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And lions, snakes, and tigers, slew.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But every monkey, ape, and bear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ever was B&aacute;li's special care;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With his vast strength and mighty arm</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He kept them from all scathe and harm.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And so the earth with hill, wood, seas,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was filled with mighty ones like these&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of various shape and race and kind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With proper homes to each assigned.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With R&aacute;ma's champions fierce and strong</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The earth was overspread,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High as the hills and clouds, a throng</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With bodies vast and dread.</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now when the high-souled monarch's rite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The A&#347;vamedh, was finished quite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their sacrificial dues obtained,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Gods their heavenly homes regained.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The lofty-minded saints withdrew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each to his place, with honor due,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And kings and chieftains, one and all,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who came to grace the festival.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Da&#347;aratha, ere they went,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Addressed them thus benevolent:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Now may you, each with joyful heart,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Peace and good luck attend you there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And blessing, is my friendly prayer;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let cares of state each mind engage</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A monarch from his throne expelled</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such care a meed in heaven will bring</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Better than rites and offering.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such care a king his country owes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As man upon himself bestows,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When for his body he provides</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Raiment and every need besides.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For future days should kings foresee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And keep the present error-free.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus did the King the kings exhort&mdash;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O mighty King, with justice reign,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And still thy people's love retain.&quot;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The King and Rishya&#347;ring elate</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Entered the royal city's gate&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In front the chaplain rode.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, loved and honored with all care</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By monarch and by courtier, there</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The glorious saint abode.</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The monarch called a Br&aacute;hman near</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And said, &quot;Now speed away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Ka&#347;yap's son, the mighty seer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with all reverence say&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The holy child he holds so dear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermit of the noble mind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose equal it were hard to find,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Returned, is dwelling here.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Go, and instead of me do thou</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before that best of hermits bow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That still he may for his dear son,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Show me the favor I have won.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as the King these words had said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Ka&#347;yap's son the Br&aacute;hman sped.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before the hermit low he bent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And did obeisance, reverent;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then with meek words his grace to crave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The message of his lord he gave:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The high-souled father of his bride</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Had called thy son his rites to guide&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those rites are o'er, the steed is slain;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy noble child is come again.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as the saint that speech had heard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His spirit with desire was stirred</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To seek the city of the King</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And to his cot his son to bring.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With young disciples at his side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forth on his way the hermit hied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While peasants from their hamlets ran</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To reverence the holy man.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each with his little gift of food,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forth came the village multitude,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, as they humbly bowed the head,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;What may we do for thee?&quot; they said.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then he, of Br&aacute;hmans first and best,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gathered people thus addressed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Now tell me, for I fain would know,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Why is it I am honored so?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They to the high-souled saint replied:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Our ruler is with thee allied.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our master's order we fulfil;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O Br&aacute;hman, let thy mind be still.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With joy the saintly hermit heard</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each pleasant and delightful word,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And poured a benediction down</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On King and ministers and town.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Glad at the words of that high saint</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Some servants hastened to acquaint</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their King, rejoicing to impart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The tidings that would cheer his heart.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as the joyful tale he knew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To meet the saint the monarch flew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The guest-gift in his hand he brought,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bowed before him and besought:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;This day by seeing thee I gain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Not to have lived my life in vain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now be not wroth with me, I pray,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Because I wiled thy son away.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The best of Br&aacute;hmans answer made:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Be not, great lord of Kings, afraid.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy virtues have not failed to win</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My favor, O thou pure of sin.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then in the front the saint was placed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The King came next in joyous haste,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with him entered his abode,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Mid glad acclaim as on they rode.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To greet the sage the reverent crowd</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Raised suppliant hands and humbly bowed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then from the palace many a dame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Following well-dressed &#346;&aacute;nt&aacute; came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stood by the mighty saint and cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;See, honor's source, thy son's dear bride.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The saint, who every virtue knew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His arms around his daughter threw,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with a father's rapture pressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The lady to his wondering breast.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Arising from the saint's embrace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She bowed her low before his face,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And then, with palm to palm applied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stood by her hermit father's side.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He for his son, as laws ordain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Performed the rite that frees from stain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, honored by the wise and good,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With him departed to the wood.</span><br />

<h4>VI&#346;V&Aacute;MITRA'S SPEECH</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermit heard with high content</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That speech so wondrous eloquent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And while each hair with joy arose,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He thus made answer at the close:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Good is thy speech, O noble King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And like thyself in everything.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So should their lips be wisdom-fraught</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom kings begot, Va&#347;ishtha taught.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The favor which I came to seek</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou grantest ere my tongue can speak.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But let my tale attention claim,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And hear the need for which I came.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O King, as Scripture texts allow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A holy rite employs me now.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two fiends who change their forms at will</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Impede that rite with cursed skill.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Oft when the task is nigh complete,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These worst of fiends my toil defeat,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Throw bits of bleeding flesh, and o'er</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The altar shed a stream of gore.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When thus the rite is mocked and stayed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all my pious hopes delayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Cast down in heart the spot I leave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And spent with fruitless labor grieve.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor can I, checked by prudence, dare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let loose my fury on them there&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The muttered curse, the threatening word,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In such a rite must ne'er be heard.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy grace the rite from check can free,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And yield the fruit I long to see.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy duty bids thee, King, defend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The suffering guest, the suppliant friend.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Give me thy son, thine eldest born,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom locks like raven's wings adorn.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That hero youth, the truly brave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of thee, O glorious King, I crave.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For he can lay those demons low</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who mar my rites and work me woe:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My power shall shield the youth from harm,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And heavenly might shall nerve his arm.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And on my champion will I shower</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unnumbered gifts of varied power&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such gifts as shall ensure his fame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And spread through all the worlds his name.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be sure those fiends can never stand</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before the might of R&aacute;ma's hand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And mid the best and bravest none</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Can slay that pair but Raghu's son.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Entangled in the toils of Fate</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those sinners, proud and obstinate,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are, in their fury overbold,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No match for R&aacute;ma, mighty-souled.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor let a father's breast give way</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Too far to fond affection's sway.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Count thou the fiends already slain:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My word is pledged, nor pledged in vain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I know the hero R&aacute;ma well</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In whom high thoughts and valor dwell;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So does Va&#347;ishtha, so do these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Engaged in long austerities.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If thou would do the righteous deed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And win high fame, thy virtue's meed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fame that on earth shall last and live,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To me, great King, thy R&aacute;ma give.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If to the words that I have said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With Saint Va&#347;ishtha at their head</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy holy men, O King, agree,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then let thy R&aacute;ma go with me.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ten nights my sacrifice will last,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And ere the stated time be past</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those wicked fiends, those impious twain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Must fall by wondrous R&aacute;ma slain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Let not the hours, I warn thee, fly,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fixt for the rite, unheeded by;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Good luck have thou, O royal Chief,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor give thy heart to needless grief.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus in fair words with virtue fraught,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The pious glorious saint besought.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But the good speech with poignant sting</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pierced ear and bosom of the King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who, stabbed with pangs too sharp to bear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fell prostrate and lay fainting there.</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His tortured senses all astray,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Awhile the hapless monarch lay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then slowly gathering thought and strength</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra spoke at length:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;My son is but a child, I ween;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This year he will be just sixteen.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My darling with the lotus eyes?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A mighty army will I bring</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That calls me master, lord, and King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with its countless squadrons fight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Against these rovers of the night.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I, even I, my bow in hand,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy guarded sacrifice shall be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Completed, from all hindrance free.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thither will I my journey make:</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No match is he for demon foes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who magic arts to arms oppose.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O chief of saints, I have no power,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of R&aacute;ma reft, to live one hour&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mine aged heart at once would break:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>R&aacute;ma, my child, thou must not take.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nine thousand circling years have fled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With all their seasons o'er my head,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And as a hard-won boon, O Sage,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These sons have come to cheer mine age.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My dearest love amid the four</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is he whom first his mother bore,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still dearer for his virtue's sake;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>R&aacute;ma, my child, thou must not take.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But if, unmoved by all I say,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A fourfold army all complete.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What is the demons' might, O Sage?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who are they? What their parentage?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What is their size? What beings lend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their power to guard them and befriend?</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or I or all my armed band?</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Once favored by the Eternal Sire</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He plagues the worlds in ceaseless ire,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For peerless power and might renowned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By giant bands encompassed round.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vi&#347;ravas for his sire they hold,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gods, spirits, bards of heavenly birth,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Much less can mortal man avail.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He draws, I hear, from out the breast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The valor of the mightiest.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No, ne'er can I with him contend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or with the forces he may send.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How can I then my darling lend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Godlike, unskilled in battle? No,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I will not let my young child go.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Foes of thy rite, those mighty ones,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He, &#346;iva's self who led the way.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon fair Sarj&uacute;'s southern shore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They now had walked a league or more,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When thus the sage in accents mild</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To R&aacute;ma said: &quot;Beloved child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This lustral water duly touch:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My counsel will avail thee much.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forget not all the words I say,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor let the occasion slip away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lo, with two spells I thee invest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mighty and the mightiest.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O'er thee fatigue shall ne'er prevail,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor age nor change thy limbs assail.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thee powers of darkness ne'er shall smite</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In tranquil sleep or wild delight.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No one is there in all the land</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thine equal for the vigorous hand.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou, when thy lips pronounce the spell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shalt have no peer in heaven or hell.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>None in the world with thee shall vie,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O sinless one, in apt reply&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In fortune, knowledge, wit, and tact,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wisdom to plan and skill to act.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This double science take, and gain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Glory that shall for aye remain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wisdom and judgment spring from each</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of these fair spells whose use I teach.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hunger and thirst unknown to thee,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High in the worlds thy rank shall be.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For these two spells with might endued,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are the Great Father's heavenly brood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thee, O Chief, may fitly grace,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou glory of Kakutstha's race.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Virtues which none can match are thine,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lord, from thy birth, of gifts divine&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And now these spells of might shall cast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fresh radiance o'er the gifts thou hast.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma duly touched the wave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Raised suppliant hands, bowed low his head,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And took the spells the hermit gave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose soul on contemplation fed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From him whose might these gifts enhanced</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A brighter beam of glory glanced:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So shines in all his autumn blaze</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Day-God of the thousand rays.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermit's wants those youths supplied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As pupils used to holy guide.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And then the night in sweet content</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On Sarj&uacute;'s pleasant bank they spent.</span><br />

<h4>THE HERMITAGE OF LOVE</h4>


<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as appeared the morning light</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Up rose the mighty anchorite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus to youthful R&aacute;ma said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who lay upon his leafy bed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;High fate is hers who calls thee son:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Arise, 'tis break of day;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rise, Chief, and let those rites be done</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Due at the morning's ray.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At that great sage's high behest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Up sprang the princely pair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To bathing rites themselves addressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And breathed the holiest prayer.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their morning task completed, they</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That store of holy works, to pay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The worship saints may claim.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then to the hallowed spot they went</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Along fair Sarj&uacute;'s side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where mix her waters confluent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With three-pathed Gang&aacute;'s tide.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There was a sacred hermitage</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where saints devout of mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their lives through many a lengthened age</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To penance had resigned.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That pure abode the princes eyed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With unrestrained delight,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus unto the saint they cried,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rejoicing at the sight:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Whose is that hermitage we see?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who makes his dwelling there?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Full of desire to hear are we:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O Saint, the truth declare.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermit, smiling, made reply</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To the two boys' request:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Hear, R&aacute;ma, who in days gone by</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This calm retreat possessed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kandarpa in apparent form,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>(Called K&aacute;ma by the wise,)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dared Um&aacute;'s new-wed lord to storm</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And make the God his prize.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Gainst Sth&aacute;nu's self, on rites austere</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And vows intent, they say,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His bold rash hand he dared to rear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though Sth&aacute;nu cried, Away!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But the God's eye with scornful glare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fell terrible on him,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dissolved the shape that was so fair</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And burnt up every limb.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Since the great God's terrific rage</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Destroyed his form and frame,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>K&aacute;ma in each succeeding age</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has borne Ananga's name.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So, where his lovely form decayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This land is Anga styled:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sacred to him of old this shade,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And hermits undefiled.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here Scripture-talking elders sway</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each sense with firm control,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And penance-rites have washed away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All sin from every soul.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One night, fair boy, we here will spend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A pure stream on each hand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with to-morrow's light will bend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our steps to yonder strand.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here let us bathe, and free from stain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To that pure grove repair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sacred to K&aacute;ma, and remain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One night in comfort there.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With penance' far-discerning eye</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The saintly men beheld</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their coming, and with transport high</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each holy bosom swelled.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Ku&#347;ik's son the gift they gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That honored guest should greet&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Water they brought his feet to lave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And showed him honor meet.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>R&aacute;ma and Lakshman next obtained</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In due degree their share&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then with sweet talk the guests remained,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And charmed each listener there.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The evening prayers were duly said</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With voices calm and low:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then on the ground each laid his head</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And slept till morning's glow.</span><br />

<h4>THE FOREST OF T&Aacute;DAK&Aacute;</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When the fair light of morning rose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The princely tamers of their foes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Followed, his morning worship o'er,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermit to the river's shore.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The high-souled men with thoughtful care</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A pretty barge had stationed there.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All cried, &quot;O lord, this barge ascend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with thy princely followers bend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To yonder side thy prosperous way&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With nought to check thee or delay.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor did the saint their rede reject:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He bade farewell with due respect,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And crossed, attended by the twain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That river rushing to the main.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When now the bark was half-way o'er,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>R&aacute;ma and Lakshman heard the roar,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That louder grew and louder yet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of waves by dashing waters met.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma asked the mighty seer:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;What is the tumult that I hear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of waters cleft in mid-career?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as the speech of R&aacute;ma, stirred</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By deep desire to know, he heard,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The pious saint began to tell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What caused the waters' roar and swell:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;On high Kail&aacute;sa's distant hill</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There lies a noble lake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose waters, born from Brahm&aacute;'s will,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The name of M&aacute;nas take.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thence, hallowing where'er they flow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The streams of Sarj&uacute; fall,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And wandering through the plains below</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Embrace Ayodhy&aacute;'s wall.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still, still preserved in Sarj&uacute;'s name</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sarovar's fame we trace,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The flood of Brahm&aacute; whence she came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To run her holy race.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To meet great Gang&aacute; here she hies</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With tributary wave&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hence the loud roar ye hear arise,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of floods that swell and rave.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here, pride of Raghu's line, do thou</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In humble adoration bow.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He spoke. The princes both obeyed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And reverence to each river paid.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They reached the southern shore at last,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And gayly on their journey passed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A little space beyond there stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A gloomy awe-inspiring wood.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The monarch's noble son began</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To question thus the holy man:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Whose gloomy forest meets mine eye,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like some vast cloud that fills the sky?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pathless and dark it seems to be,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where birds in thousands wander free;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where shrill cicadas' cries resound,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And fowl of dismal note abound.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lion, rhinoceros, and bear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Boar, tiger, elephant, are there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There shrubs and thorns run wild:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dh&aacute;o, S&aacute;l, Bignonia, Bel, are found,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And every tree that grows on ground:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How is the forest styled?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The glorious saint this answer made:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Dear child of Raghu, hear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who dwells within the horrid shade</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That looks so dark and drear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where now is wood, long ere this day</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two broad and fertile lands,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Malaja and Kar&uacute;sha lay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Adorned by heavenly hands.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here, mourning friendship's broken ties,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lord Indra of the thousand eyes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hungered and sorrowed many a day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His brightness soiled with mud and clay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When in a storm of passion he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Had slain his dear friend Namuchi.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then came the Gods and saints who bore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their golden pitchers brimming o'er</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With holy streams that banish stain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bathed Lord Indra pure again.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When in this land the God was freed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From spot and stain of impious deed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For that his own dear friend he slew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>High transport thrilled his bosom through.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then in his joy the lands he blessed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And gave a boon they long possessed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Because these fertile lands retain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The washings of the blot and stain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>('Twas thus Lord Indra sware,)</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Malaja and Kar&uacute;sha's name</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall celebrate with deathless fame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My malady and care.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;So be it,&quot; all the Immortals cried,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When Indra's speech they heard&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with acclaim they ratified</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The names his lips conferred.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Long time, O victor of thy foes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These happy lands had sweet repose,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And higher still in fortune rose.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At length a spirit, loving ill,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>T&aacute;dak&aacute;, wearing shapes at will&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose mighty strength, exceeding vast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A thousand elephants' surpassed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was to fierce Sunda, lord and head</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of all the demon armies, wed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From her, Lord Indra's peer in might</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Giant M&aacute;r&iacute;cha sprang to light;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And she, a constant plague and pest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These two fair realms has long distressed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now dwelling in her dark abode</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A league away she bars the road:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And we, O R&aacute;ma, hence must go</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where lies the forest of the foe.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now on thine own right arm rely,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And my command obey:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Smite the foul monster that she die,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And take the plague away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To reach this country none may dare,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fallen from its old estate,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which she, whose fury nought can bear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has left so desolate.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And now my truthful tale is told&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How with accursed sway</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The spirit plagued this wood of old,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And ceases not to-day.&quot;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He thus pronounced M&aacute;r&iacute;cha's doom:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'A giant's form and shape assume,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And then, by mighty anger swayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On T&aacute;dak&aacute; this curse he laid:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Thy present form and semblance quit,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And wear a shape thy mood to fit;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Changed form and feature by my ban,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A fearful thing that feeds on man.'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She, by his awful curse possessed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And mad with rage that fills her breast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has on this land her fury dealt</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where once the saint Agastya dwelt.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Go, R&aacute;ma, smite this monster dead,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wicked plague, of power so dread,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And further by this deed of thine</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The good of Br&aacute;hmans and of kine.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy hand alone can overthrow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In all the worlds, this impious foe.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor let compassion lead thy mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To shrink from blood of womankind;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A monarch's son must ever count</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The people's welfare paramount&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And whether pain or joy he deal</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dare all things for his subjects' weal;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yea, if the deed bring praise or guilt,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If life be saved or blood be spilt:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such, through all time, should be the care</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of those a kingdom's weight who bear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Slay, R&aacute;ma, slay this impious fiend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For by no law her life is screened.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So Manthar&aacute;, as bards have told,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Virochan's child, was slain of old</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Indra, when in furious hate</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She longed the earth to devastate.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So K&aacute;vya's mother, Bhrigu's wife,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who loved her husband as her life,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When Indra's throne she sought to gain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Vishnu's hand of yore was slain.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By these and high-souled kings beside,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Struck down, have lawless women died.&quot;</span><br />

<h4>THE DEATH OF T&Aacute;DAK&Aacute;</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus spoke the saint. Each vigorous word</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The noble monarch's offspring heard&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, reverent hands together laid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His answer to the hermit made:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;My sire and mother bade me aye</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy word, O mighty Saint, obey.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So will I, O most glorious, kill</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This T&aacute;dak&aacute; who joys in ill&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For such my sire's, and such thy will.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To aid with mine avenging hand</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Br&aacute;hmans, kine, and all the land,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Obedient, heart and soul, I stand.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus spoke the tamer of the foe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And by the middle grasped his bow.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Strongly he drew the sounding string</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That made the distant welkin ring.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scared by the mighty clang the deer</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That roamed the forest shook with fear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And T&aacute;dak&aacute; the echo heard,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And rose in haste from slumber stirred.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In wild amaze, her soul aflame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With fury towards the spot she came.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When that foul shape of evil mien</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And stature vast as e'er was seen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wrathful son of Raghu eyed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He thus unto his brother cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Her dreadful shape, O Lakshman, see,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A form to shudder at and flee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hideous monster's very view</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Would cleave a timid heart in two.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Behold the demon hard to smite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Defended by her magic might.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My hand shall stay her course to-day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And shear her nose and ears away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No heart have I her life to take:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I spare it for her sex's sake.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My will is but&mdash;with minished force&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To check her in her evil course.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While thus he spoke, by rage impelled&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Roaring as she came nigh,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fiend her course at R&aacute;ma held</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With huge arms tossed on high.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her, rushing on, the seer assailed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With a loud cry of hate;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus the sons of Raghu hailed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Fight, and be fortunate.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then from the earth a horrid cloud</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of dust the demon raised,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And for awhile in darkling shroud</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wrapt Raghu's sons amazed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then calling on her magic power</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fearful fight to wage,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She smote him with a stony shower,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till R&aacute;ma burned with rage.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then pouring forth his arrowy rain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That stony flood to stay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With wing&egrave;d darts, as she charged amain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He shore her hands away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As T&aacute;dak&aacute; still thundered near</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus maimed by R&aacute;ma's blows,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lakshman in fury severed sheer</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The monster's ears and nose.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Assuming by her magic skill</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A fresh and fresh disguise,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She tried a thousand shapes at will,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then vanished from their eyes.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When G&aacute;dhi's son of high renown</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still saw the stony rain pour down</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon each princely warrior's head,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With words of wisdom thus he said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Enough of mercy, R&aacute;ma, lest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This sinful evil-working pest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Disturber of each holy rite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Repair by magic arts her might.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Without delay the fiend should die,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For, see, the twilight hour is nigh.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And at the joints of night and day</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Such giant foes are hard to slay.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma, skilful to direct</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His arrow to the sound&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With shafts the mighty demon checked</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who rained her stones around.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She, sore impeded and beset</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By R&aacute;ma and his arrowy net&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though skilled in guile and magic lore,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rushed on the brothers with a roar.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deformed, terrific, murderous, dread,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Swift as the levin on she sped&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like cloudy pile in autumn's sky,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lifting her two vast arms on high:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When R&aacute;ma smote her with a dart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shaped like a crescent, to the heart.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sore wounded by the shaft that came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With lightning speed and surest aim,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Blood spurting from her mouth and side,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She fell upon the earth and died.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as the Lord who rules the sky</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saw the dread monster lifeless lie,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He called aloud, Well done! well done!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the Gods honored Raghu's son.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Standing in heaven the Thousand-eyed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With all the Immortals, joying cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Lift up thine eyes, O Saint, and see</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Gods and Indra nigh to thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This deed of R&aacute;ma's boundless might</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has filled our bosoms with delight.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now, for our will would have it so,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Raghu's son some favor show.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Invest him with the power which nought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But penance gains, and holy thought.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Those heavenly arms on him bestow&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To thee entrusted long ago</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By great Kri&#347;&aacute;&#347;va best of kings,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Son of the Lord of living things.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>More fit recipient none can be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Than he who joys in following thee;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And for our sakes the monarch's seed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has yet to do a mighty deed.&quot;</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To R&aacute;ma then they lowly bent,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;What cloudlike wood is that which near</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mountain's side I see appear?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O tell me, for I long to know:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Its pleasant aspect charms me so.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Its glades are full of deer at play,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sweet birds sing on every spray.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Passed is the hideous wild&mdash;I feel</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A land that is so fair to view.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then tell me all, thou holy Sage,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And whose this pleasant hermitage</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In which those wicked ones delight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To mar and kill each holy rite&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with foul heart and evil deed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy sacrifice, great Saint, impede.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To whom, O Sage, belongs this land</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In which thine altars ready stand?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis mine to guard them, and to slay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The giants who the rites would stay.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All this, O best of saints, I burn</span><br />

<h4>THE PERFECT HERMITAGE</h4>


<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus spoke the prince of boundless might,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus replied the anchorite:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Chief of the mighty arm, of yore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lord Vishnu, whom the Gods adore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For holy thought and rites austere,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of penance made his dwelling here.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This ancient wood was called of old</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Grove of the Dwarf, the mighty-souled&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when perfection he attained</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The grove the name of Perfect gained.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bali of yore, Virochan's son,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dominion over Indra won&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And when with power his proud heart swelled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O'er the three worlds his empire held.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When Bali then began a rite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Gods and Indra in affright</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sought Vishnu in this place of rest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus with prayers the God addressed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Bali, Virochan's mighty son,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His sacrifice has now begun:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of boundless wealth, that demon king</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is bounteous to each living thing.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though suppliants flock from every side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The suit of none is e'er denied.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whate'er, where'er, howe'er the call,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He hears the suit and gives to all.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now with thine own illusive art</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Perform, O Lord, the helper's part:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Assume a dwarfish form, and thus</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From fear and danger rescue us.'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus in their dread the Immortals sued</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The God, a dwarfish shape indued:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before Virochan's son he came,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Three steps of land his only claim.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The boon obtained, in wondrous wise</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lord Vishnu's form increased in size;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Through all the worlds, tremendous, vast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>God of the Triple Step, he passed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The whole broad earth from side to side</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He measured with one mighty stride&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spanned with the next the firmament,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with the third through heaven he went.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus was the king of demons hurled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By Vishnu to the nether world&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus the universe restored</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Indra's rule, its ancient lord.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And now because the Immortal God</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This spot in dwarflike semblance trod,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The grove has aye been loved by me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For reverence of the devotee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But demons haunt it, prompt to stay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each holy offering I would pay.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be thine, O lion-lord, to kill</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These giants that delight in ill.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This day, beloved child, our feet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall rest within the calm retreat;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And know, thou chief of Raghu's line,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My hermitage is also thine.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He spoke; and soon the anchorite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With joyous looks that beamed delight,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With R&aacute;ma and his brother stood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Within the consecrated wood.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as they saw the holy man,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With one accord together ran</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The dwellers in the sacred shade,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And to the saint their reverence paid&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And offered water for his feet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The gift of honor, and a seat;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And next with hospitable care</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They entertained the princely pair.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The royal tamers of their foes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rested awhile in sweet repose&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then to the chief of hermits sued</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Standing in suppliant attitude:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Begin, O best of saints, we pray,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Initiatory rites to-day.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This Perfect Grove shall be anew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made perfect, and thy words be true.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, thus addressed, the holy man,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The very glorious sage, began</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The high preliminary rite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Restraining sense and appetite.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Calmly the youths that night reposed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And rose when morn her light disclosed&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their morning worship paid, and took</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of lustral water from the brook.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus purified they breathed the prayer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then greeted Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra where</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That conquering pair, of royal race,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Skilled to observe due time and place&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To K&uacute;&#347;ik's hermit son addressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In timely words, their meet request:&mdash;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Had made reply in words like these,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The youths began, disdaining sleep,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Six days and nights their watch to keep&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The warrior pair who tamed the foe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unrivalled benders of the bow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Kept watch and ward unwearied still</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To guard the saint from scathe and ill.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Twas now the sixth returning day, </span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hour foretold had passed away.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma cried: &quot;O Lakshman, now!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Firm, watchful, resolute be thou.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fiends as yet have kept afar</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From the pure grove in which we are;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet waits us, ere the day shall close,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dire battle with the demon foes.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While thus spoke R&aacute;ma, borne away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By longing for the deadly fray,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>See! bursting from the altar came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The sudden glory of the flame;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Round priest and deacon, and upon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Grass, ladles, flowers, the splendor shone&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the high rite, in order due,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With sacred texts began anew.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But then a loud and fearful roar</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Re-echoed through the sky;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And like vast clouds that shadow o'er</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The heavens in dark July,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Involved in gloom of magic might</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two fiends rushed on amain&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>M&aacute;r&iacute;cha, Rover of the Night,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Suv&aacute;hu, and their train.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As on they came in wild career</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thick blood in rain they shed;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And R&aacute;ma saw those things of fear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Impending overhead. Then, soon as those accursed two</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who showered down blood he spied,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus to his brother brave and true</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spoke R&aacute;ma lotus-eyed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Now, Lakshman, thou these fiends shalt see,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Man-eaters, foul of mind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before my mortal weapon flee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like clouds before the wind.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He spoke. An arrow, swift as thought,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon his bow he pressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And smote, to utmost fury wrought,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>M&aacute;r&iacute;cha on the breast.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deep in his flesh the weapon lay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Winged by the mystic spell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, hurled a hundred leagues away,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In ocean's flood he fell.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma, when he saw the foe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Convulsed and mad with pain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Neath the chill-pointed weapon's blow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Lakshman spoke again:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;See, Lakshman, see! this mortal dart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That strikes a numbing chill,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hath struck him senseless with the smart,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But left him breathing still.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But these who love the evil way</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And drink the blood they spill,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rejoicing holy rites to stay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fierce plagues, my hand shall kill.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He seized another shaft, the best,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Aglow with living flame;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>It struck Suv&aacute;hu on the chest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And dead to earth he came.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Again a dart, the Wind-God's own,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upon his string he laid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all the demons were overthrown&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The saints no more afraid.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When thus the fiends were slain in fight,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Disturbers of each holy rite,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Due honor by the saints was paid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To R&aacute;ma for his wondrous aid:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So Indra is adored when he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has won some glorious victory.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Success at last the rite had crowned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra gazed around&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And seeing every side at rest,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Won by the rite the glorious prize</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still in his royal palace lies&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Laid up in oil of precious scent</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With aloes-wood and incense blent.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma answering, &quot;Be it so,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made ready with the rest to go.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The saint himself was now prepared,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But ere beyond the grove he fared,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He turned him and in words like these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Addressed the sylvan deities:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Farewell! each holy rite complete,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I leave the hermits' perfect seat:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Gang&aacute;'s northern shore I go</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beneath Him&aacute;laya's peaks of snow.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With reverent steps he paced around</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The limits of the holy ground&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And then the mighty saint set forth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And took his journey to the north.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His pupils, deep in Scripture's page,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Followed behind the holy sage,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And servants from the sacred grove</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A hundred wains for convoy drove.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The very birds that winged that air,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The very deer that harbored there,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forsook the glade and leafy brake</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And followed for the hermits' sake.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They travelled far, till in the west</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The sun was speeding to his rest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And made, their portioned journey o'er,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their halt on &#346;ona's distant shore.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermits bathed when sank the sun,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And every rite was duly done&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Oblations paid to Fire, and then</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sate round their chief the holy men.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>R&aacute;ma and Lakshman lowly bowed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In reverence to the hermit crowd&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And R&aacute;ma, having sate him down</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before the saint of pure renown,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With humble palms together laid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His eager supplication made:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;What country, O my lord, is this,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fair-smiling in her wealth and bliss?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Deign fully, O thou mighty Seer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To tell me, for I long to hear.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Moved by the prayer of R&aacute;ma, he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Told forth the country's history.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And we, forsooth, have charms to bring</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But honor first we maidens prize.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Far may the hour, we pray, be hence,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our truthful father's choice refuse,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And for ourselves our husbands choose.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our honored sire our lord we deem,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They sought the palace of their sire,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There fell upon the ground with sighs,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Again the hundred maidens sighed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Touched with their heads his feet, and cried:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The God of Wind, pervading space,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Would bring on us a foul disgrace,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And choosing folly's evil way</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From virtue's path in scorn would stray.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But we in words like these reproved</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The God of Wind whom passion moved:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Farewell, O Lord! A sire have we,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No women uncontrolled and free.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Go, and our sire's consent obtain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>If thou our maiden hands wouldst gain.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;With patience, daughters, bear your fate,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yours was a deed supremely great</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When with one mind you kept from shame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The honor of your father's name.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Patience, when men their anger vent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is woman's praise and ornament;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet when the Gods inflict the blow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hard is it to support the woe.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Patience, my girls, exceeds all price&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis alms, and truth, and sacrifice.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Patience is virtue, patience fame:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Patience upholds this earthly frame.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And now, I think, is come the time</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To wed you in your maiden prime.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now, daughters, go where'er you will:</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>About their marriage to debate.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Since then, because the Wind-God bent</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our journey of to-morrow stay.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No leaf on any tree is stirred&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hushed in repose are beast and bird:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where'er you turn, on every side,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dense shades of night the landscape hide.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The light of eve is fled: the skies,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thick-studded with their host of eyes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seem a star-forest overhead,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where signs and constellations spread.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now rises, with his pure cold ray,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The moon that drives the shades away,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And with his gentle influence brings</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Joy to the hearts of living things.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now, stealing from their lairs, appear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The beasts to whom the night is dear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now spirits walk, and every power</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That revels in the midnight hour.&quot;</span><br />

<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mighty hermit's tale was o'er,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He closed his lips and spoke no more.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The holy men on every side,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Well done! well done,&quot; with reverence cried,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The high-souled lords of Ku&#347;a's line.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thy great name is sounded most,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O Saint, amid the noble host.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thy dear sister&mdash;fairest she</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of streams, the high-born Kau&#347;ik&iacute;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Diffusing virtue where she flows,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>New splendor on thy lineage throws.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus by the chief of saints addressed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The son of G&aacute;dhi turned to rest;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So, when his daily course is done,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sinks to his rest the beaming sun.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>R&aacute;ma, with Lakshman, somewhat stirred</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To marvel by the tales they heard,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Turned also to his couch, to close</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His eyelids in desired repose.</span><br />

<h4>THE BIRTH OF GANG&Aacute;</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hours of night now waning fast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On &#346;ona's pleasant shore they passed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then, when the dawn began to break.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To R&aacute;ma thus the hermit spake:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The light of dawn is breaking clear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hour of morning rites is near.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rise, R&aacute;ma, rise, dear son, I pray,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And make thee ready for the way.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma rose, and finished all</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His duties at the hermit's call&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Prepared with joy the road to take,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus again in question spake:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Here fair and deep the &#346;ona flows,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And many an isle its bosom shows:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What way, O Saint, will lead us o'er</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And land us on the farther shore?&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The saint replied: &quot;The way I choose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is that which pious hermits use.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For many a league they journeyed on</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till, when the sun of mid-day shone,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hermit-haunted flood was seen</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of J&aacute;hnav&iacute;, the Rivers' Queen.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as the holy stream they viewed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thronged with a white-winged multitude</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of s&aacute;rases and swans, delight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Possessed them at the lovely sight;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And then prepared the hermit band</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To halt upon that holy strand.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They bathed as Scripture bids, and paid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Oblations due to God and shade.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Fire they burnt the offerings meet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And sipped the oil, like Amrit sweet.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then pure and pleased they sate around</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Saint Vi&#347;v&aacute;mitra, on the ground.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The holy men of lesser note,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In due degree, sate more remote,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While Raghu's sons took nearer place</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By virtue of their rank and race.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then R&aacute;ma said: &quot;O Saint, I yearn</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The three-pathed Gang&aacute;'s tale to learn.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus urged, the sage recounted both</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The birth of Gang&aacute; and her growth:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;The mighty hill with metals stored,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Him&aacute;laya, is the mountains' lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The father of a lovely pair</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of daughters fairest of the fair&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their mother, offspring of the will</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Meru, everlasting hill,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Men&aacute;, Him&aacute;laya's darling, graced</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With beauty of her dainty waist.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gang&aacute; was elder-born:&mdash;then came</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fair one known by Um&aacute;'s name.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then all the Gods of heaven, in need</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Gang&aacute;'s help their vows to speed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To great Him&aacute;laya came and prayed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Mountain King to yield the maid.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He, not regardless of the weal</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the three worlds, with holy zeal</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His daughter to the Immortals gave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gang&aacute; whose waters cleanse and save&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who roams at pleasure, fair and free,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Purging all sinners, to the sea.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The three-pathed Gang&aacute; thus obtained,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The Gods their heavenly homes regained.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Long time the sister Um&aacute; passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In vows austere and rigid fast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And the King gave the devotee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Immortal Rudra's bride to be&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Matching with that unequalled Lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His Um&aacute; through the worlds adored.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So now a glorious station fills</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each daughter of the King of Hills&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One honored as the noblest stream,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One mid the Goddesses supreme.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus Gang&aacute;, King Him&aacute;laya's child,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The heavenly river, undefiled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rose bearing with her to the sky</span><br />

<h4>THE SONS OF SAGAR</h4>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The saint in accents sweet and clear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus told his tale for R&aacute;ma's ear&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thus anew the holy man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A legend to the prince began:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;There reigned a pious monarch o'er</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ayodhy&aacute; in the days of yore:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sagar his name:&mdash;no child had he,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And children much he longed to see.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His honored consort, fair of face,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sprang from Vidarbha's royal race&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Ke&#347;in&iacute;, famed from early youth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For piety and love of truth.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Arishtanemi's daughter fair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With whom no maiden might compare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In beauty, though the earth is wide,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sumati, was his second bride.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With his two queens afar he went,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And weary days in penance spent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fervent, upon Him&aacute;laya's hill</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Where springs the stream called Bhrigu's rill.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nor did he fail that saint to please</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With his devout austerities,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, when a hundred years had fled,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus the most truthful Bhrigu said:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'From thee, O Sagar, blameless King,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A mighty host of sons shall spring,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And thou shalt win a glorious name</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which none, O Chief, but thou shall claim.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One of thy queens a son shall bear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Maintainer of thy race and heir;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And of the other there shall be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sons sixty thousand born to thee.'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus as he spake, with one accord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To win the grace of that high lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The queens, with palms together laid,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In humble supplication prayed:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Which queen, O Br&aacute;hman, of the pair,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The many, or the one shall bear?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Most eager, Lord, are we to know,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And as thou sayest be it so,'</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With his sweet speech the saint replied:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Yourselves, O Queens, the choice decide.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Your own discretion freely use</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which shall the one or many choose:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One shall the race and name uphold,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The host be famous, strong, and bold.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which will have which?' Then Ke&#347;in&iacute;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The mother of one heir would be.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sumati, sister of the King</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of all the birds that ply the wing,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To that illustrious Br&aacute;hman sued</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That she might bear the multitude&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose fame throughout the world should sound</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For mighty enterprise renowned.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Around the saint the monarch went,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bowing his head, most reverent.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then with his wives, with willing feet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Resought his own imperial seat,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Time passed. The elder consort bare</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A son called Asamanj, the heir.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then Sumati, the younger, gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Birth to a gourd, O hero brave,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose rind, when burst and cleft in two,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gave sixty thousand babes to view.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All these with care the nurses laid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In jars of oil; and there they stayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Till, youthful age and strength complete,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forth speeding from each dark retreat&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All peers in valor, years, and might,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The sixty thousand came to light.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Prince Asamanj, brought up with care,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scourge of his foes, was made the heir.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But liegemen's boys he used to cast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To Sarj&uacute;'s waves that hurried past&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Laughing the while in cruel glee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their dying agonies to see.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This wicked prince who aye withstood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The counsel of the wise and good,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who plagued the people in his hate,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His father banished from the state.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His son, kind-spoken, brave, and tall,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was An&#347;um&aacute;n, beloved of all.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Long years flew by. The King decreed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To slay a sacrificial steed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Consulting with his priestly band</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He vowed the rite his soul had planned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, Veda-skilled, by their advice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Made ready for the sacrifice.&quot;</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With shaggy hills and wooded plains.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When, with the changing moon, distressed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And longing for a moment's rest,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His mighty head the monster shakes,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But turning from the east aside</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Southward again their task they plied.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There Mah&aacute;padma held his place,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The best of all his mighty race&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like some huge hill, of monstrous girth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Upholding on his head the earth.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When the vast beast the princes saw,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They reached the seat of Soma's sway.</span><br />

<p>The drama is always the latest development of a national poetry&mdash;for the
origin of poetry is in the religious rite, where the hymn or the ode is
used to celebrate the glories of some divinity, or some hero who has
been received into the circle of the gods. This at least is the case in
Sanscrit as in Greek literature, where the hymn and ballad precede the
epic. The epic poem becomes the stable form of poetry during the middle
period in the history of literature, both in India and Greece. The union
of the lyric and the epic produces the drama. The speeches uttered by
the heroes in such poems as the &quot;Iliad&quot; are put into the mouths of real
personages who appear in sight of the audience and represent with
fitting gestures and costumes the characters of the story. The dialogue
is interspersed with songs or odes, which reach their perfection in the
choruses of Sophocles.</p>

<p>The drama is undoubtedly the most intellectual, as it is the most
artificial, form of poetry. The construction of the plot, and the
arrangement of the action, give room for the most thoughtful and
deliberate display of genius. In this respect the Greek drama stands
forth as most philosophically perfect. The drama, moreover, has always
been by far the most popular form of poetry; because it aids, as much as
possible, the imagination of the auditor, and for distinctness and
clearness of impression stands pre&euml;minent above both the epic narrative
and the emotional description of the lyric.</p>

<p>The drama in India appears to have been a perfectly indigenous creation,
although it was of very late development, and could not have appeared
even so early as the Alexandrian pastorals which marked the last phase
of Greek poetry. When it did appear, it never took the perfect form of
the drama at Athens. It certainly borrowed as little from Greece as it
did from China or Japan, and the Persians and Arabians do not appear to
have produced any dramatic masterpieces. The greatest of dramatists in
the Sanscrit language is undoubtedly K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa, whose date is placed, by
different scholars, anywhere from the first to the fifth century of our
era. His masterpiece, and indeed the masterpiece of the Indian drama, is
the &quot;&#346;akoontal&aacute;,&quot; which has all the graces as well as most of the faults
of Oriental poetry. There can be no doubt that to most Europeans the
charm of it lies in the exquisite description of natural scenery and of
that atmosphere of piety and religious calm&mdash;almost mediaeval in its
austere beauty and serenity&mdash;which invests the hermit life of India. The
abode of the ascetics is depicted with a pathetic grace that we only
find paralleled in the &quot;Admetus&quot; of Euripides. But at the same time the
construction of the drama is more like such a play as Milton's &quot;Comus,&quot;
than the closely-knit, symmetrical, and inevitable progress of such a
work of consummate skill as the &quot;King Oedipus&quot; of Sophocles. Emotion,
and generally the emotion of love, is the motive in the &quot;&#346;akoontal&aacute;&quot; of
K&aacute;lid&aacute;sa, and different phases of feeling, rather than the struggles of
energetic action, lead on to the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the play. The
introduction of supernatural agencies controlling the life of the
personages, leaves very little room for the development and description
of human character. As the fate of the hero is dependent altogether upon
the caprice of superhuman powers, the moral elements of a drama are but
faintly discernible. Thus the central action of &#346;akoontal&aacute; hinges on the
fact that the heroine, absorbed in thoughts of love, neglects to welcome
with due respect the great saint Durvasas&mdash;certainly a trifling and
venial fault&mdash;but he is represented as blighting her with a curse which
results in all the unhappiness of the drama, and which is only ended at
last by the intervention of a more powerful being. By this principle of
construction the characters are reduced to mere shadow creations:
beautiful as arabesques, delicate as a piece of ivory carving, tinted
like the flat profiles of an Oriental fan or the pattern of a porcelain
vase, but deficient in robustness and vigorous coloring. Humanity is
absolutely dwarfed and its powers rendered inoperative by the crowd of
supernatural creatures that control its destiny. Even in the &quot;Tempest&quot;
of Shakespeare, in which the supernatural plays a greater part than in
any other English drama, the strength and nobility of human character
are allowed full play&mdash;and man in his fortitude, in his intellect and
will, even more than in his emotions, keeps full possession of the
stage, and imparts a reality to every scene which makes the wildest
flight of fancy bear a real relation to the common experiences of human
life.</p>

<p>The &quot;&#346;akoontal&aacute;&quot; is divided into seven acts, and is a mixture of prose
and verse;&mdash;each character rising in the intensity of emotional
utterance into bursts of lyric poetry. The first act introduces the King
of India, Dushyanta, armed with bow and arrows, in a chariot with his
driver. They are passing through a forest in pursuit of a black
antelope, which they fail to overtake before the voice of some hermit
forbids them to slay the creature as it belongs to the hermitage. The
king piously desists and reaches the hermitage of the great saint Kanwa,
who has left his companions in charge of his foster-daughter,
&#346;akoontal&aacute;, while he is bound on a pilgrimage. Following these hermits
the king finds himself within the precincts of a sacred grove, where
rice is strewn on the ground to feed the parrots that nest in the hollow
trunks, and where the unterrified antelopes do not start at the human
voice. The king stops his chariot and alights, so as not to disturb the
dwellers in the holy wood. He feels a sudden throb in his right arm,
which augurs happy love, and sees hermit maidens approaching to sprinkle
the young shrubs, with watering-pots suited to their strength. The forms
of these hermit maidens eclipse those found in queenly halls, as the
luxuriance of forest vines excels the trim vineyards of cultivation.
Amongst these maidens the king, concealed by the trees, observes
&#346;akoontal&aacute;, dressed in the bark garment of a hermit&mdash;like a blooming bud
enclosed within a sheath of yellow leaves. When she stands by the
<i>ke&#347;ara</i>-tree, the king is impressed by her beauty, and regrets that she
is, if of a purely Br&aacute;hmanic origin, forbidden to marry one of the
warrior class, even though he be a king. A very pretty description is
given of the pursuit of &#346;akoontal&aacute; by a bee which her sprinkling has
startled from a jasmine flower. From this bee she is rescued by the
king, and is dismayed to find that the sight of the stranger affects her
with an emotion unsuited to the holy grove. She hurries off with her two
companions, but as she goes she declares that a prickly <i>kusa</i>-grass has
stung her foot; a <i>kuruvaka</i>-bush has caught her garment, and while her
companions disentangle it, she takes a long look at the king, who
confesses that he cannot turn his mind from &#346;akoontal&aacute;. This is the
opening episode of their love.</p>

<p>The second act introduces the king's jester, a Br&aacute;hman on confidential
terms with his master, who, while Dushyanta is thinking of love, is
longing to get back to the city. He is tired of the hot jungle, the
nauseating water of bitter mountain streams, the racket of fowlers at
early dawn, and the eternal galloping, by which his joints are bruised.
The king is equally tired of hunting, and confesses that he cannot bend
his bow against those fawns which dwell near &#346;akoontal&aacute;'s abode, and
have taught their tender glance to her. He calls back the beaters sent
out to surround the forest, takes off his hunting-suit, and talks to the
jester about the charms of &#346;akoontal&aacute;&mdash;whom the Creator, he says, has
formed by gathering in his mind all lovely shapes, so as to make a
peerless woman-gem. He recalls the glance which she shot at him as she
cried, &quot;a <i>kusha-grass</i> has stung my foot.&quot; Meanwhile two hermits
approach him with the news that the demons have taken advantage of
Kanwa's absence to disturb the sacrifices. They request him to take up
his abode in the grove for a few days, in order to vanquish the enemies.
A messenger arrives to tell him that his mother, in four days, will be
offering a solemn sacrifice for her son's welfare, and invites his
presence at the rite. But he cannot leave &#346;akoontal&aacute;, and sends the
jester M&aacute;thavya in his stead, telling him to say nothing about his love
for &#346;akoontal&aacute;.</p>

<p>In the third act the love of the king and the hermit girl reaches its
climax. The king is found walking in the hermitage, invoking the God of
Love, whose shafts are flowers, though the flowery darts are hard as
steel. &quot;Mighty God of Love, hast Thou no pity on me?&quot; What better
relief, he asks, than the sight of my beloved? He traces &#346;akoontal&aacute;, by
the broken tubes which bore the blossoms she had culled, to the arbor,
enclosed by the plantation of canes, and shaded by vines, at whose
entrance he observes in the sand the track of recent footsteps. Peering
through the branches, he perceives her reclining on a stone seat strewn
with flowers. Her two companions are with her, and she is sick unto
death. The king notices that her cheeks are wasted, her breasts less
swelling, her slender waist more slender, her roseate hue has grown
pale, and she seems like some poor <i>madhave</i> creeper touched by winds
that have scorched its leaves. Her companions anxiously inquire the
cause of her sickness, and, after much hesitation, she reveals her love
by inscribing a poem, with her fingernail, on a lotus leaf smooth as a
parrot's breast. The king hears the avowal of her love, rushes in to
her, and declares his passion: adding that daughters of a royal saint
have often been wedded by <i>Gandharva</i> rites, without ceremonies or
parental consent, yet have not forfeited the father's blessing. He thus
overcomes her scruples. Gautam&iacute;, the matron of the hermitage, afterwards
enters, and asks, &quot;My child, is your fever allayed?&quot; &quot;Venerable mother,&quot;
is the reply, &quot;I feel a grateful change.&quot; As the king sits in solitude
that evening in the deserted arbor, he hears a voice outside, uttering
the verses&mdash;&quot;The evening rites have begun; but, dark as the clouds of
night, the demons are swarming round the altar fires.&quot; With these words
of ill-omen the third act comes to an end.</p>

<p>The fourth act describes the fulfilment of this evil omen. The king has
now returned to the city, and has given &#346;akoontal&aacute; a signet ring, with
an inscription on it, pronouncing that after there have elapsed as many
days as there are letters in this inscription he will return. As the two
maiden companions of &#346;akoontal&aacute; are culling flowers in the garden of the
hermitage, they hear a voice exclaiming, &quot;It is I! give heed!&quot; This is
the great Durvasas, whom &#346;akoontal&aacute;, lost in thoughts of her absent
husband, has neglected at once to go forth to welcome. The voice from
behind the scenes is soon after heard uttering a curse&mdash;&quot;Woe unto her
who is thus neglectful of a guest,&quot; and declaring that Dushyanta, of
whom alone she is thinking, regardless of the presence of a pious saint,
shall forget her in spite of all his love, as the wine-bibber forgets
his delirium. The Hindoo saint is here described in all his arrogance
and cruelty. One of the maidens says that he who had uttered the curse
is now retiring with great strides, quivering with rage&mdash;for his wrath
is like a consuming fire. A pretty picture is given of &#346;akoontal&aacute;, who
carries on her finger the signet ring, which has the virtue of restoring
the king's love, if ever he should forget her. &quot;There sits our beloved
friend,&quot; cries one of the maidens: &quot;motionless as a picture; her cheek
supported by her left hand, so absorbed in thoughts of her absent lover
that she is unconscious of her own self&mdash;how much more of a passing
stranger?&quot;</p>

<p>In the fourth act there is an exquisite description of the return of
Kanwa from his pilgrimage, and the preparations for the start of
&#346;akoontal&aacute; for her husband's palace, in the city. The delicate pathos of
the scene is worthy of Euripides. &quot;Alas! Alas!&quot; exclaim the two maidens,
&quot;Now &#346;akoontal&aacute; has disappeared behind the trees of the forest. Tell us,
master, how shall we enter again the sacred grove made desolate by her
departure?&quot; But the holy calm, broken for a moment by the excitement of
his child's departure, is soon restored to Kanwa's mind. &quot;Now that my
child is dismissed to her husband's home, tranquillity regains my soul.&quot;
The closing reflection is worthy of a Greek dramatist: &quot;Our maids we
rear for the happiness of others; and now that I have sent her to her
husband I feel the satisfaction that comes from restoring a trust.&quot;</p>

<p>In the fifth act, the scene is laid in Dushyanta's palace, where the
king is living, under the curse of Durvasas, in complete oblivion of
&#346;akoontal&aacute;. The life of the court is happily suggested, with its
intrigues and its business. The king has yet a vague impression of
restlessness, which, on hearing a song sung behind the scenes, prompts
him to say, &quot;Why has this strain flung over me so deep a melancholy, as
though I was separated from some loved one; can this be the faint
remembrance of affections in some previous existence?&quot; It is here that
the hermits, with Gautam&iacute;, arrive, bringing &#346;akoontal&aacute;, soon to be made
a mother, into the presence of the king; but she has been utterly
forgotten by him. He angrily denies his marriage; and when she proposes
to bring forth the ring, she finds she has lost it from her finger. &quot;It
must have slipped off,&quot; suggested Gautam&iacute;, &quot;when thou wast offering
homage to &#346;ach&iacute;'s holy lake.&quot; The king smiles derisively. &#346;akoontal&aacute;
tries to quicken his memory:&mdash;&quot;Do you remember how, in the jasmine
bower, you poured water from the lotus cup into the hollow of my hand?
Do you remember how you said to my little fawn, Drink first, but she
shrunk from you&mdash;and drank water from my hand, and you said, with a
smile, 'Like trusts Like,' for you are two sisters in the same grove.&quot;
The king calls her words &quot;honeyed falsehoods.&quot; &#346;akoontal&aacute; buries her
face in her mantle and bursts into tears.</p>

<p>The tenderness of this scene, its grace and delicacy, are quite idyllic,
and worthy of the best ages of the pastoral drama. The ring is at
length restored to Dushyanta, having been found by a fisherman in the
belly of a carp. On its being restored to the king's finger, he is
overcome with a flood of recollection: he gives himself over to mourning
and forbids the celebration of the Spring festival. He admits that his
palsied heart had been slumbering, and that, now it is roused by
memories of his fawn-eyed love, he only wakes to agonies of remorse.
Meanwhile &#346;akoontal&aacute; had been carried away like a celestial nymph to the
sacred grove of Ka&#347;yapa, far removed from earth in the upper air. The
king, being summoned by Indra to destroy the brood of giants,
descendants of Kalamemi, the monster of a hundred arms and heads,
reaches in the celestial car Indra, the grove where dwell his wife and
child, an heroic boy whom the hermits call Sarva-damana&mdash;the all-tamer.
The recognition and reconciliation of husband and wife are delineated
with the most delicate skill, and the play concludes with a prayer to
Shiva.</p>

<p>Observe, that in order to secure the correct pronunciation of the title
of this Drama, &quot;&#346;akuntal&aacute;&quot; has been spelt &quot;&#346;a-koontal&aacute;,&quot; the <i>u</i> being
pronounced like the <i>u</i> in the English word <i>rule</i>.</p>

<p>The vowel <i>a</i> must invariably be pronounced with a dull sound, like the
<i>a</i> in <i>organ</i>, or the <i>u</i> in <i>fun, sun. Dushyanta</i> must therefore be
pronounced as if written <i>Dooshyunta</i>. The long vowel <i>a</i> is pronounced
like the <i>a</i> in <i>last, cart; i</i> like the <i>i</i> in <i>pin, sin</i>; <i>&iacute;</i> like the
<i>i</i> in <i>marine; e</i> like the <i>e</i> in <i>prey; o</i> like the <i>o</i> in <i>so; ai</i>
like the <i>ai</i> in <i>aisle; au</i> like <i>au</i> in the German word <i>baum</i>, or
like the <i>ou</i> in <i>our</i>.</p>

<p>The consonants are generally pronounced as in English, but <i>g</i> has
always the sound of <i>g</i> in <i>gun, give</i>, never of <i>g</i> in <i>gin. S</i> with
the accent over it (&#347;) has the sound of <i>s</i> in <i>sure</i>, or of the last

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; AND ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Your request, Sir, is an honor.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;The sage Kanwa lives in the constant practice of austerities.
How, then, can this friend of yours be called his daughter?</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;I will explain to you, Sir. You have heard of an illustrious
sage of regal caste, Vi&#347;w&aacute;mitra, whose family name is Ka&uacute;sika.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I have.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Know that he is the real father of our friend. The venerable
Kanwa is only her reputed father. He it was who brought her up, when she
was deserted by her mother.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;&quot;Deserted by her mother!&quot; My curiosity is excited; pray let me
hear the story from the beginning.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;You shall hear it, Sir. Some time since, this sage of regal
caste, while performing a most severe penance on the banks of the river
God&aacute;var&iacute;, excited the jealousy and alarm of the gods; insomuch that they
despatched a lovely nymph named Menak&aacute; to interrupt his devotions.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;The inferior gods, I am aware, are jealous of the power which the
practice of excessive devotion confers on mortals.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Well, then, it happened that Vi&#347;w&aacute;mitra, gazing on the
bewitching beauty of that nymph at a season when, spring being in its
glory&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Stops short, and appears confused</i>.</span><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;The rest may be easily divined. &#346;akoontal&aacute;, then, is the
offspring of the nymph.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Just so.</p>

<h4>Scene.&mdash;A Plain on the Skirts of the Forest</h4>
<br />

<p><i>Enter the Jester, M&aacute;thavya, in a melancholy mood</i>.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>sighing</i>].&mdash;Heigh-ho! what an unlucky fellow I am! worn to a
shadow by my royal friend's sporting propensities. &quot;Here's a deer!&quot;
&quot;There goes a boar!&quot; &quot;Yonder's a tiger!&quot; This is the only burden of our
talk, while in the heat of the meridian sun we toil on from jungle to
jungle, wandering about in the paths of the woods, where the trees
afford us no shelter. Are we thirsty? We have nothing to drink but the
foul water of some mountain stream, filled with dry leaves which give it
a most pungent flavor. Are we hungry? We have nothing to eat but roast
game, which we must swallow down at odd times, as best we can. Even at
night there is no peace to be had. Sleeping is out of the question, with
joints all strained by dancing attendance upon my sporting friend; or if
I do happen to doze, I am awakened at the very earliest dawn by the
horrible din of a lot of rascally beaters and huntsmen, who must needs
surround the wood before sunrise, and deafen me with their clatter. Nor
are these my only troubles. Here's a fresh grievance, like a new boil
rising upon an old one! Yesterday, while we were lagging behind, my
royal friend entered yonder hermitage after a deer; and there, as
ill-luck would have it? caught sight of a beautiful girl, called
&#346;akoontal&aacute;, the hermit's daughter. From that moment, not another thought
about returning to the city! and all last night, not a wink of sleep did
he get for thinking of the damsel. What is to be done? At any rate, I
will be on the watch for him as soon as he has finished his toilet.
[[<i>Walking and looking about</i>.] Oh! here he comes, attended by the
Yavana women with bows in their hands, and wearing garlands of wild
flowers. What shall I do? I have it. I will pretend to stand in the
easiest attitude for resting my bruised and crippled limbs.<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Stands leaning on a staff</i>.</span><br />

<p><i>Enter King Dushyanta, followed by a retinue in the manner described</i>.</p>

KING.&mdash;True, by no easy conquest may I win her,<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet are my hopes encouraged by her mien.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Love is not yet triumphant; but, methinks,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hearts of both are ripe for his delights.</span><br />
</div>[<i>Smiling</i>.] Ah! thus does the lover delude himself; judging of the
state of his loved one's feelings by his own desires. But yet,<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The stolen glance with half-averted eye,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The hesitating gait, the quick rebuke</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Addressed to her companion, who would fain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Have stayed her counterfeit departure; these</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Are signs not unpropitious to my suit.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So eagerly the lover feeds his hopes,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Claiming each trivial gesture for his own.</span><br />
</div>
<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>still in the same attitude</i>].&mdash;Ah, friend, my hands cannot
move to greet you with the usual salutation. I can only just command my
lips to wish your majesty victory.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Why, what has paralyzed your limbs?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;You might as well ask me how my eye comes to water after you
have poked your finger into it.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I don't understand you; speak more intelligibly.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Ah, my dear friend, is yonder upright reed transformed into a
crooked plant by its own act, or by the force of the current?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;The current of the river causes it, I suppose.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Aye; just as you are the cause of my crippled limbs.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;How so?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Here are you living the life of a wild man of the woods in a
savage, unfrequented region, while your state affairs are left to shift
for themselves; and as for poor me, I am no longer master of my own
limbs, but have to follow you about day after day in your chases after
wild animals, till my bones are all crippled and out of joint. Do, my
dear friend, let me have one day's rest.</p>

<p>KING [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;This fellow little knows, while he talks in this
manner, that my mind is wholly engrossed by recollections of the
hermit's daughter, and quite as disinclined to the chase as his own.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No longer can I bend my well-braced bow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Against the timid deer; nor e'er again</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>These her beloved associates, who enjoy</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The privilege of her companionship;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Teaching her tender glances in return.</span><br />
</div>
<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>looking in the King's face</i>].&mdash;I may as well speak to the
winds, for any attention you pay to my requests. I suppose you have
something on your mind, and are talking it over to yourself.</p>

<p>KING [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;I was only thinking that I ought not to disregard a
friend's request.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Then may the King live forever!</p>          <span style="float: right;">[<i>Moves off</i>.</span><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;Stay a moment, my dear friend. I have something else to say to
you.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Say on, then.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;When you have rested, you must assist me in another business,
which will give you no fatigue.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;In eating something nice, I hope.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;You shall know at some future time.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;No time better than the present.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;What ho! there.</p>

<p>WARDER [<i>entering</i>].&mdash;What are your Majesty's commands?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;O Raivataka! bid the General of the forces attend.</p>

<p>WARDER.&mdash;I will, Sire.        [<i>Exit and re&euml;nters with the General</i>]
Come forward, General; his Majesty is looking towards you, and has some
order to give you.</p>

<p>GENERAL [<i>looking at the King</i>].&mdash;Though hunting is known to produce ill
effects, my royal master has derived only benefit from it. For</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like the majestic elephant that roams</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O'er mountain wilds, so does the King display</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A stalwart frame, instinct with vigorous life.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His brawny arms and manly chest are scored</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By frequent passage of the sounding string;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unharmed he bears the mid-day sun; no toil</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His mighty spirit daunts; his sturdy limbs,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stripped of redundant flesh, relinquish nought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of their robust proportions, but appear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In muscle, nerve, and sinewy fibre cased.</span><br />
</div><p>[<i>Approaching the King</i>.] Victory to the King! We have tracked the wild
beasts to their lairs in the forest. Why delay, when everything is
ready?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;My friend M&aacute;thavya here has been disparaging the chase, till he
has taken away all my relish for it.</p>

<p>GENERAL [<i>aside to M&aacute;thavya</i>].&mdash;Persevere in your opposition, my good
fellow; I will sound the King's real feelings, and humor him
accordingly. [<i>Aloud</i>]. The blockhead talks nonsense, and your Majesty,
in your own person, furnishes the best proof of it. Observe, Sire, the
advantage and pleasure the hunter derives from the chase.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Freed from all grosser influences, his frame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Loses its sluggish humors, and becomes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Buoyant, compact, and fit for bold encounter.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis his to mark with joy the varied passions,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fierce heats of anger, terror, blank dismay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of forest animals that cross his path.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then what a thrill transports the hunter's soul,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When, with unerring course, his driven shaft</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pierces the moving mark! Oh! 'tis conceit</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In moralists to call the chase a vice;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What recreation can compare with this?</span><br />
</div>
<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>angrily</i>].&mdash;Away! tempter, away! The King has recovered his
senses, and is himself again. As for you, you may, if you choose, wander
about from forest to forest, till some old bear seizes you by the nose,
and makes a mouthful of you.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;My good General, as we are just now in the neighborhood of a
consecrated grove, your panegyric upon hunting is somewhat ill-timed,
and I cannot assent to all you have said. For the present,<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All undisturbed the buffaloes shall sport</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In yonder pool, and with their ponderous horns</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scatter its tranquil waters, while the deer,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Couched here and there in groups beneath the shade</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of spreading branches, ruminate in peace.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And all securely shall the herd of boars</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Feed on the marshy sedge; and thou, my bow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With slackened string enjoy a long repose.</span><br />
</div>
<p>GENERAL.&mdash;So please your Majesty, it shall be as you desire.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Recall, then, the beaters who were sent in advance to surround
the forest. My troops must not be allowed to disturb this sacred
retreat, and irritate its pious inhabitants.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Know that within the calm and cold recluse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lurks unperceived a germ of smothered flame,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All-potent to destroy; a latent fire</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That rashly kindled bursts with fury forth:&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As in the disc of crystal that remains</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Cool to the touch, until the solar ray</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Falls on its polished surface, and excites</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The burning heat that lies within concealed.</span><br />
</div>
<p>GENERAL.&mdash;Your Majesty's commands shall be obeyed.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Off with you, you son of a slave! Your nonsense won't go down
here, my fine fellow.</p>          <span style="float: right;">[<i>Exit General</i>.</span><br />

<p>KING [<i>looking at his attendants</i>].&mdash;Here, women, take my hunting-dress;

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Now that you have got rid of these plagues, who have been
buzzing about us like so many flies, sit down, do, on that stone slab,
with the shade of the tree as your canopy, and I will seat myself by you
quite comfortably.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Go you, and sit down first.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Come along, then.</p>

<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Both walk on a little way, and seat themselves</i>.</span><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;M&aacute;thavya, it may be said of you that you have never beheld
anything worth seeing: for your eyes have not yet looked upon the
loveliest object in creation.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;How can you say so, when I see your Majesty before me at this
moment?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;It is very natural that everyone should consider his own friend
perfect; but I was alluding to &#346;akoontal&aacute;, the brightest ornament of
these hallowed groves.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;I understand well enough, but I am not going to
humor him. [<i>Aloud</i>.] If, as you intimate, she is a hermit's daughter,
you cannot lawfully ask her in marriage. You may as well, then, dismiss
her from your mind, for any good the mere sight of her can do.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Think you that a descendant of the mighty Puru could fix his
affections on an unlawful object?</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though, as men say, the offspring of the sage,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By its support from premature decay.</span><br />
</div>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;This passion of yours for a rustic maiden, when
you have so many gems of women at home in your palace, seems to me very
like the fancy of a man who is tired of sweet dates, and longs for sour
tamarinds as a variety.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;You have not seen her, or you would not talk in this fashion.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;I can quite understand it must require something surpassingly

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;If that's the case, she must indeed throw all other beauties
into the shade.</p>

KING.&mdash;To my mind she really does.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This peerless maid is like a fragrant flower,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whose perfumed breath has never been diffused;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A tender bud, that no profaning hand</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has dared to sever from its parent stalk;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A gem of priceless water, just released</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pure and unblemished from its glittering bed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Or may the maiden haply be compared</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To sweetest honey, that no mortal lip</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Has sipped; or, rather to the mellowed fruit</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of virtuous actions in some former birth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now brought to full perfection? Lives the man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whom bounteous heaven has destined to espouse her?</span><br />
</div>
<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Make haste, then, to her aid; you have no time to lose, if
you don't wish this fruit of all the virtues to drop into the mouth of
some greasy-headed rustic of devout habits.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;The lady is not her own mistress, and her foster-father is not at
home.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Well, but tell me, did she look at all kindly upon you?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Maidens brought up in a hermitage are naturally shy and reserved;
but for all that,<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She did look towards me, though she quick withdrew</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her stealthy glances when she met my gaze;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She smiled upon me sweetly, but disguised</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With maiden grace the secret of her smiles.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Coy love was half unveiled; then, sudden checked</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By modesty, left half to be divined.</span><br />
</div>
<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Why, of course, my dear friend, you never could seriously
expect that at the very first sight she would fall over head and ears in
love with you, and without more ado come and sit in your lap.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;When we parted from each other, she betrayed her liking for me by
clearer indications, but still with the utmost modesty.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scarce had the fair one from my presence passed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When, suddenly, without apparent cause,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She stopped, and counterfeiting pain, exclaimed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;My foot is wounded by this prickly grass.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then glancing at me tenderly, she feigned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Another charming pretext for delay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Pretending that a bush had caught her robe,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And turned as if to disentangle it.</span><br />
</div>
<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;I trust you have laid in a good stock of provisions, for I
see you intend making this consecrated grove your game-preserve, and
will be roaming here in quest of sport for some time to come.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;You must know, my good fellow, that I have been recognized by
some of the inmates of the hermitage. Now I want the assistance of your
fertile invention, in devising some excuse for going there again.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;There is but one expedient that I can suggest. You are the
King, are you not?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;What then?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Say you have come for the sixth part of their grain, which
they owe you for tribute.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;No, no, foolish man; these hermits pay me a very different kind
of tribute, which I value more than heaps of gold or jewels; observe,<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The tribute which my other subjects bring</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Must moulder into dust, but holy men</span><br />

a Saint.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In this secluded grove, whose sacred joys</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A store of purest merit for himself,</span><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;My dear M&aacute;thavya, are you not full of longing to see &#346;akoontal&aacute;?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;To tell you the truth, though I was just now brimful of
desire to see her, I have not a drop left since this piece of news about
the demons.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Never fear; you shall keep close to me for protection.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Well, you must be my guardian-angel, and act the part of a
very Vishnu<a name="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> to me.</p>

<p>WARDER&mdash;[<i>entering</i>].&mdash;Sire, the chariot is ready, and only waits to
conduct you to victory. But here is a messenger named Karabhaka, just
arrived from your capital, with a message from the Queen, your mother.</p>

<p>KING&mdash;[<i>respectfully</i>].&mdash;How say you? a messenger from the venerable
Queen?</p>

<p>WARDER.&mdash;Even so.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Introduce him at once.</p>

<p>WARDER.&mdash;I will, Sire. [<i>Goes out, and re-&euml;nters with Karabhaka</i>.]
Behold the King! Approach.</p>

<p>KARABHAKA.&mdash;Victory to the King! The Queen-mother bids me say that in
four days from the present time she intends celebrating a solemn
ceremony for the advancement and preservation of her son. She expects
that your Majesty will honor her with your presence on that occasion.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;This places me in a dilemma. Here, on the one hand, is the
commission of these holy men to be executed; and, on the other, the
command of my revered parent to be obeyed. Both duties are too sacred to
be neglected. What is to be done?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;You will have to take up an intermediate position between the
two, like King Tri&#347;anku, who was suspended between heaven and earth,
because the sage Vi&#347;w&aacute;mitra commanded him to mount up to heaven, and the
gods ordered him down again.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I am certainly very much perplexed. For here,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Two different duties are required of me</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In widely distant places; how can I</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In my own person satisfy them both?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thus is my mind distracted and impelled</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In opposite directions, like a stream</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That, driven back by rocks, still rushes on,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forming two currents in its eddying course.</span><br />
</div><p>[<i>Reflecting</i>.] Friend M&aacute;thavya, as you were my playfellow in childhood,
the Queen has always received you like a second son; go you, then, back
to her and tell her of my solemn engagement to assist these holy men.
You can supply my place in the ceremony, and act the part of a son to
the Queen.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;With the greatest pleasure in the world; but don't suppose
that I am really coward enough to have the slightest fear of those
trumpery demons.</p>

<p>KING [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;Oh! of course not; a great Br&aacute;hman like you could not
possibly give way to such weakness.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;You must let me travel in a manner suitable to the King's
younger brother.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Yes, I shall send my retinue with you, that there may be no
further disturbance in this sacred forest.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>with a strut</i>].&mdash;Already I feel quite like a young prince.</p>

<p>KING [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;This is a giddy fellow, and in all probability he will
let out the truth about my present pursuit to the women of the palace.
What is to be done? I must say something to deceive him. [<i>Aloud to
M&aacute;thavya, taking him by the hand</i>.] Dear friend, I am going to the
hermitage wholly and solely out of respect for its pious inhabitants,
and not because I have really any liking for &#346;akoontal&aacute;, the hermit's
daughter. Observe,<br />

<p>YOUNG BR&Aacute;HMAN.&mdash;How wonderful is the power of King Dushyanta! No sooner
did he enter our hermitage, than we were able to proceed with our
sacrificial rites, unmolested by the evil demons.<br />

</div>I must now, therefore, make haste and deliver to the sacrificing priests
these bundles of Ku&#347;a-grass, to be strewn round the altar. [<i>Walking and
looking about; then addressing someone off the stage</i>.] Why, Priyamvad&aacute;,
for whose use are you carrying that ointment of Us&iacute;ra-root and those
lotus leaves with fibres attached to them? [<i>Listening for her answer</i>.]
What say you?&mdash;that &#346;akoontal&aacute; is suffering from fever produced by
exposure to the sun, and that this ointment is to cool her burning
frame? Nurse her with care, then, Priyamvad&aacute;, for she is cherished by
our reverend Superior as the very breath of his nostrils. I, for my
part, will contrive that soothing waters, hallowed in the sacrifice, be
administered to her by the hands of Gautam&iacute;.<br />

something similar to that of the lovers we have read about in romances.
Tell us frankly what is the cause of your disorder. It is useless to
apply a remedy, until the disease be understood.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Anas&uacute;y&aacute; bears me out in my suspicion.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;I am, indeed, deeply in love; but cannot rashly
disclose my passion to these young girls.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;What Anas&uacute;y&aacute; says, dear &#346;akoontal&aacute;, is very just. Why give
so little heed to your ailment? Every day you are becoming thinner;
though I must confess your complexion is still as beautiful as ever.</p>

KING.&mdash;Priyamvad&aacute; speaks most truly.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sunk is her velvet cheek; her wasted bosom</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Loses its fulness; e'en her slender waist</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Grows more attenuate; her face is wan,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her shoulders droop;&mdash;as when the vernal blasts</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sear the young blossoms of the M&aacute;dhav&iacute;,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Blighting their bloom; so mournful is the change,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet in its sadness, fascinating still,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Inflicted by the mighty lord of love</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On the fair figure of the hermit's daughter.</span><br />
</div>
<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Dear friends, to no one would I rather reveal the nature of
my malady than to you; but I should only be troubling you.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; AND ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Nay, this is the very point about which we are
so solicitous. Sorrow shared with affectionate friends is relieved of
half its poignancy.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Pressed by the partners of her joys and griefs, Her much beloved
companions, to reveal The cherished secret locked within her breast,
She needs must utter it; although her looks Encourage me to hope, my
bosom throbs As anxiously I listen for her answer.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Know then, dear friends, that from the first moment the
illustrious Prince, who is the guardian of our sacred grove, presented
himself to my sight&mdash;<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Stops short, and appears confused.</i>]</span><br />

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; AND ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Say on, dear &#346;akoontal&aacute;, say on.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Ever since that happy moment, my heart's affections have
been fixed upon him, and my energies of mind and body have all deserted
me, as you see.</p>

<p>KING [<i>with rapture</i>].&mdash;Her own lips have uttered the words I most
longed to hear.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Love lit the flame, and Love himself allays</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My burning fever, as when gathering clouds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rise o'er the earth in summer's dazzling noon,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And grateful showers dispel the morning heat.</span><br />
</div>
<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;You must consent, then, dear friends, to contrive some
means by which I may find favor with the King, or you will have ere long
to assist at my funeral.</p>

<p>KING [<i>with rapture</i>].&mdash;Enough! These words remove all my doubts.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>aside to Anas&uacute;y&aacute;</i>].&mdash;She is far gone in love, dear Anas&uacute;y&aacute;,
and no time ought to be lost. Since she has fixed her affections on a
monarch who is the ornament of Puru's line, we need not hesitate for a
moment to express our approval.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;I quite agree with you.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>aloud</i>].&mdash;We wish you joy, dear &#346;akoontal&aacute;. Your affections
are fixed on an object in every respect worthy of you. The noblest river
will unite itself to the ocean, and the lovely M&aacute;dhav&iacute;-creeper clings
naturally to the Mango, the only tree capable of supporting it.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Why need we wonder if the beautiful constellation Vi&#347;&aacute;kh&aacute; pines
to be united with the Moon.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;By what stratagem can we best secure to our friend the
accomplishment of her heart's desire, both speedily and secretly?</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;The latter point is all we have to think about. As to
&quot;speedily,&quot; I look upon the whole affair as already settled.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;How so?</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Did you not observe how the King betrayed his liking by the
tender manner in which he gazed upon her, and how thin he has become the
last few days, as if he had been lying awake thinking of her?</p>

<p>KING [<i>looking at himself</i>].&mdash;Quite true! I certainly am becoming thin
from want of sleep:&mdash;<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As night by night in anxious thought I raise</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This wasted arm to rest my sleepless head,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My jewelled bracelet, sullied by the tears</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That trickle from my eyes in scalding streams,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Slips towards my elbow from my shrivelled wrist.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Oft I replace the bauble, but in vain;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So easily it spans the fleshless limb</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That e'en the rough and corrugated skin,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scarred by the bow-string, will not check its fall.</span><br />
</div>
<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>thoughtfully</i>].&mdash;An idea strikes me, Anas&uacute;y&aacute;. Let
&#346;akoontal&aacute; write a love-letter; I will conceal it in a flower, and
contrive to drop it in the King's path. He will surely mistake it for
the remains of some sacred offering, and will, in all probability, pick
it up.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;A very ingenious device! It has my entire approval; but what
says &#346;akoontal&aacute;?</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;I must consider before I can consent to it.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Could you not, dear &#346;akoontal&aacute;, think of some pretty
composition in verse, containing a delicate declaration of your love?</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Well, I will do my best; but my heart trembles when I think
of the chances of a refusal.</p>

KING [<i>with rapture</i>].&mdash;Too timid maid, here stands the man from whom<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou fearest a repulse; supremely blessed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To call thee all his own. Well might he doubt</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His title to thy love; but how couldst thou</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Believe thy beauty powerless to subdue him?</span><br />
</div>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; AND ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;You undervalue your own merits, dear
&#346;akoontal&aacute;. What man in his senses would intercept with the skirt of his
robe the bright rays of the autumnal moon, which alone can allay the
fever of his body?</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;Then it seems I must do as I am bid.<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Sits down and appears to be thinking.</i>]</span><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;How charming she looks! My very eyes forget to wink, jealous of
losing even for an instant a sight so enchanting.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How beautiful the movement of her brow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As through her mind love's tender fancies flow!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And, as she weighs her thoughts, how sweet to trace</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The ardent passion mantling in her face!</span><br />
</div>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Dear girls, I have thought of a verse, but I have no
writing-materials at hand.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Write the letters with your nail on this lotus leaf, which
is smooth as a parrot's breast.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>after writing the verse</i>].&mdash;Listen, dear friends, and tell
me whether the ideas are appropriately expressed.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; AND ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;We are all attention.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>reads</i>].&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I know not the secret thy bosom conceals,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thy form is not near me to gladden my sight;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But sad is the tale that my fever reveals,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Of the love that consumes me by day and by night.</span><br />
</div>

<p>KING [<i>advancing hastily towards her</i>].&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Nay, Love does but warm thee, fair maiden&mdash;thy frame</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Only droops like the bud in the glare of the noon;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But me he consumes with a pitiless flame,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>As the beams of the day-star destroy the pale moon.</span><br />
</div>
<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; AND ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute; [<i>looking at him joyfully, and rising to salute
him</i>].&mdash;Welcome, the desire of our hearts, that so speedily presents
itself!</p>

<span style='float: right;'>[<i>&#346;akoontal&aacute; makes an effort to rise.</i>]</span><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;Nay, trouble not thyself, dear maiden,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Move not to do me homage; let thy limbs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Still softly rest upon their flowery couch,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And gather fragrance from the lotus stalks</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Bruised by the fevered contact of thy frame.</span><br />

friend is reposing.</p>

<span style='float: right;'>[<i>The King sits down. &#346;akoontal&aacute; is confused.</i>]</span><br />

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Anyone may see at a glance that you are deeply attached to
each other. But the affection I have for my friend prompts me to say
something of which you hardly require to be informed.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Do not hesitate to speak out, my good girl. If you omit to say
what is in your mind, you may be sorry for it afterwards.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Is it not your special office as a King to remove the
suffering of your subjects who are in trouble?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Such is my duty, most assuredly.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Know, then, that our dear friend has been brought to her
present state of suffering entirely through love for you. Her life is in
your hands; take pity on her and restore her to health.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Excellent maiden, our attachment is mutual. It is I who am the
most honored by it.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>looking at Priyamvad&aacute;</i>].&mdash;What do you mean by detaining the
King, who must be anxious to return to his royal consorts after so long
a separation?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Sweet maiden, banish from thy mind the thought</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That I could love another. Thou dost reign</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Supreme, without a rival, in my heart,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Else must I die a second deadlier death&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Killed by thy words, as erst by K&aacute;ma's shafts.</span><br />
</div>
<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Kind Sir, we have heard it said that kings have many favorite
consorts. You must not, then, by your behavior towards our dear friend,
give her relations cause to sorrow for her.</p>

KING.&mdash;Listen, gentle maiden, while in a few words I quiet your anxiety.<br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though many beauteous forms my palace grace,</span><br />

<span style="float: right;">[<i>Forces her to turn back.</i>]</span><br />

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Infringe not the rules of decorum, mighty descendant of
Puru. Remember, though I love you, I have no power to dispose of myself.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Why this fear of offending your relations, timid maid? When your
venerable foster-father hears of it, he will not find fault with you. He
knows that the law permits us to be united without consulting him.<br />

<h4>Scene.&mdash;The Garden of the Hermitage</h4>
<br />

<p><i>Enter Priyamvad&aacute; and Anas&uacute;y&aacute; in the act of gathering flowers</i>.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Although, dear Priyamvad&aacute;, it rejoices my heart to think that
&#346;akoontal&aacute; has been happily united to a husband in every respect worthy
of her, by the form of marriage prevalent among Indra's celestial
musicians, nevertheless, I cannot help feeling somewhat uneasy in my
mind.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;How so?</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;You know that the pious King was gratefully dismissed by the
hermits on the successful termination of their sacrificial rites. He has
now returned to his capital, leaving &#346;akoontal&aacute; under our care; and it
may be doubted whether, in the society of his royal consorts, he will
not forget all that has taken place in this hermitage of ours.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;On that score be at ease. Persons of his noble nature are
not so destitute of all honorable feeling. I confess, however, that
there is one point about which I am rather anxious. What, think you,
will father Kanwa say when he hears what has occurred?</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;In my opinion, he will approve the marriage.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;What makes you think so?</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;From the first, it was always his fixed purpose to bestow the
maiden on a husband worthy of her; and since heaven has given her such a
husband, his wishes have been realized without any trouble to himself.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>looking at the flower-basket</i>].&mdash;We have gathered flowers
enough for the sacred offering, dear Anas&uacute;y&aacute;.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Well, then, let us now gather more, that we may have wherewith

arrival.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Surely, &#346;akoontal&aacute; is not absent from the cottage.
[<i>Aside</i>.] Her heart at least is absent, I fear.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He, even he of whom thou thinkest, he</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall think no more of thee; nor in his heart</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Retain thine image. Vainly shalt thou strive</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To waken his remembrance of the past;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He shall disown thee, even as the sot,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Roused from his midnight drunkenness, denies</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The words he uttered in his revellings.</span><br />
</div>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Alas! alas! I fear a terrible misfortune has occurred.
&#346;akoontal&aacute;, from absence of mind, must have offended some guest whom she
was bound to treat with respect. [<i>Looking behind the scenes</i>.] Ah! yes;
I see, and no less a person than the great sage Durvasas, who is known
to be most irascible. He it is that has just cursed her, and is now
retiring with hasty strides, trembling with passion, and looking as if
nothing could turn him. His wrath is like a consuming fire.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Go quickly, dear Priyamvad&aacute;, throw yourself at his feet, and
persuade him to come back, while I prepare a propitiatory offering for
him, with water and refreshments.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;I will.</p>          <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Exit.</i></span><br />

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute; [<i>advancing hastily a few steps and stumbling</i>].&mdash;Alas! alas!
this comes of being in a hurry. My foot has slipped and my basket of
flowers has fallen from my hand.<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Stays to gather them up</i>.</span><br />

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>re&euml;ntering</i>].&mdash;Well, dear Anas&uacute;y&aacute;, I have done my best; but
what living being could succeed in pacifying such a cross-grained,
ill-tempered old fellow? However, I managed to mollify him a little.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute; [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;Even a little was much for him. Say on.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;When he refused to turn back, I implored his forgiveness in
these words: &quot;Most venerable sage, pardon, I beseech you, this first
offence of a young and inexperienced girl, who was ignorant of the
respect due to your saintly character and exalted rank.&quot;</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;And what did he reply?</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;&quot;My word must not be falsified; but at the sight of the
ring of recognition the spell shall cease.&quot; So saying, he disappeared.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Oh! then we may breathe again; for now I think of it, the King
himself, at his departure, fastened on &#346;akoontal&aacute;'s finger, as a token
of remembrance, a ring on which his own name was engraved. She has,
therefore, a remedy for her misfortune at her own command.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Come, dear Anas&uacute;y&aacute;, let us proceed with our religious
duties.          <span style='float: right;'>[<i>They walk away</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>looking off the stage</i>].&mdash;See, Anas&uacute;y&aacute;, there sits our dear
friend, motionless as a statue, resting her face on her left hand, her
whole mind absorbed in thinking of her absent husband. She can pay no
attention to herself, much less to a stranger.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Priyamvad&aacute;, let this affair never pass our lips. We must spare
our dear friend's feelings. Her constitution is too delicate to bear
much emotion.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;I agree with you. Who would think of watering a tender
jasmine with hot water?</p>

day</i>.</p>

<p>PUPIL.&mdash;My master, the venerable Kanwa, who is but lately returned from
his pilgrimage, has ordered me to ascertain how the time goes. I have
therefore come into the open air to see if it be still dark. [<i>Walking
and looking about</i>.] Oh! the dawn has already broken.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Disconsolately mourns her absent lord,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And yields her heart a prey to anxious grief.</span><br />
</div>
<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute; [<i>entering abruptly</i>].&mdash;Little as I know of the ways of the
world, I cannot help thinking that King Dushyanta is treating &#346;akoontal&aacute;
very improperly.</p>

<p>PUPIL.&mdash;Well, I must let my revered preceptor know that it is time to
offer the burnt oblation.          <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Exit.</i></span></p><br />

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;I am broad awake, but what shall I do? I have no energy to go
about my usual occupations. My hands and feet seem to have lost their
power. Well, Love has gained his object; and Love only is to blame for
having induced our dear friend, in the innocence of her heart, to
confide in such a perfidious man. Possibly, however, the imprecation of
Durvasas may be already taking effect. Indeed, I cannot otherwise
account for the King's strange conduct, in allowing so long a time to
elapse without even a letter; and that, too, after so many promises and
protestations. I cannot think what to do, unless we send him the ring
which was to be the token of recognition. But which of these austere
hermits could we ask to be the bearer of it? Then, again, Father Kanwa
has just returned from his pilgrimage: and how am I to inform him of
&#346;akoontal&aacute;'s marriage to King Dushyanta, and her expectation of being
soon a mother? I never could bring myself to tell him, even if I felt
that &#346;akoontal&aacute; had been in fault, which she certainly has not. What is
to be done?</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>entering; joyfully</i>].&mdash;Quick! quick! Anas&uacute;y&aacute;! come and
assist in the joyful preparations for &#346;akoontal&aacute;'s departure to her
husband's palace.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;My dear girl, what can you mean?</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Listen, now, and I will tell you all about it. I went just
now to &#346;akoontal&aacute;, to inquire whether she had slept comfortably&mdash;</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Well, well; go on.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;She was sitting with her face bowed down to the very ground
with shame, when Father Kanwa entered and, embracing her, of his own
accord offered her his congratulations. &quot;I give thee joy, my child,&quot; he
said, &quot;we have had an auspicious omen. The priest who offered the
oblation dropped it into the very centre of the sacred fire, though
thick smoke obstructed his vision. Henceforth thou wilt cease to be an
object of compassion. This very day I purpose sending thee, under the
charge of certain trusty hermits, to the King's palace; and shall
deliver thee into the hands of thy husband, as I would commit knowledge
to the keeping of a wise and faithful student.&quot;</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Who, then, informed the holy Father of what passed in his
absence?</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;As he was entering the sanctuary of the consecrated fire,
an invisible being chanted a verse in celestial strains.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute; [<i>with astonishment</i>].&mdash;Indeed! pray repeat it.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>repeats the verse</i>].&mdash;</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute; [<i>embracing Priyamvad&aacute;</i>].&mdash;Oh, my dear Priyamvad&aacute;, what
delightful news! I am pleased beyond measure; yet when I think that we
are to lose our dear &#346;akoontal&aacute; this very day, a feeling of melancholy
mingles with my joy.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;We shall find means of consoling ourselves after her
departure. Let the dear creature only be made happy, at any cost.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Yes, yes, Priyamvad&aacute;, it shall be so; and now to prepare our
bridal array. I have always looked forward to this occasion, and some
time since, I deposited a beautiful garland of Ke&#347;ara flowers in a
cocoa-nut box, and suspended it on a bough of yonder mango-tree. Be good
enough to stretch out your hand and take it down, while I compound
unguents and perfumes with this consecrated paste and these blades of
sacred grass.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute;.&mdash;Very well.</ br>
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Exit Anas&uacute;y&aacute;. Priyamvad&aacute; takes down the flowers.</i></span></p></ br>

hold themselves in readiness to escort &#346;akoontal&aacute;.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>listening</i>].&mdash;Quick, quick, Anas&uacute;y&aacute;! They are calling the
hermits who are to go with &#346;akoontal&aacute; to Hastin&aacute;pur.</p>

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; [<i>looking</i>].&mdash;See! there sits &#346;akoontal&aacute;, her locks arranged
even at this early hour of the morning. The holy women of the hermitage
are congratulating her, and invoking blessings on her head, while they
present her with wedding-gifts and offerings of consecrated wild-rice.
Let us join them.         <span style='float: right;'> [<i>They approach</i>.</span></p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;I ought indeed to be grateful for your kind offices, now
that I am so soon to be deprived of them. Dear, dear friends, perhaps I

<p>GAUTAM&Iacute;.&mdash;Did he create them by the power of his own mind?</p>

<p>SECOND HERMIT.&mdash;Certainly not; but you shall hear. The venerable sage
ordered us to collect flowers for &#346;akoontal&aacute; from the forest-trees; and
we went to the wood for that purpose, when</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Straightway depending from a neighboring tree</span><br />

<p>PRIYAMVAD&Aacute; AND ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Alas! what are we to do? We are unused to such
splendid decorations, and are at a loss how to arrange them. Our
knowledge of painting must be our guide. We will dispose the ornaments

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;My father, see you there my pet deer, grazing close to the

<p>KANWA.&mdash;I will not forget it.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;My poor little fawn, dost thou ask to follow an unhappy
woman who hesitates not to desert her companions? When thy mother died,
soon after thy birth, I supplied her place, and reared thee with my own
hand; and now that thy second mother is about to leave thee, who will
care for thee? My father, be thou a mother to her. My child, go back,

female Chakrav&aacute;ka-bird, whom cruel fate dooms to nightly separation
from her mate, calls to him in mournful notes from the other side of the
stream, though he is only hidden from her view by the spreading leaves
of the water-lily. Her cry is so piteous that I could almost fancy she
was lamenting her hard lot in intelligible words.</p>

<p>ANAS&Uacute;Y&Aacute;.&mdash;Say not so, dearest.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Fond bird! though sorrow lengthen out her night</span><br />

<p>KANWA.&mdash;This is it&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Most puissant prince! we here present before thee</span><br />

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;A most suitable message. I will take care to deliver it
correctly.</p>

<p>KANWA.&mdash;And now, my child, a few words of advice for thee. We hermits,
though we live secluded from the world, are not ignorant of worldly
matters.</p>

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;No, indeed. Wise men are conversant with all subjects.</p>

<p>KANWA.&mdash;Listen, then, my daughter. When thou reachest thy husband's
palace, and art admitted into his family,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Honor thy betters; ever be respectful</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To those above thee; and, should others share</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy husband's love, ne'er yield thyself a prey</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To jealousy; but ever be a friend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A loving friend, to those who rival thee</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In his affections. Should thy wedded lord</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Treat thee with harshness, thou must never be</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Harsh in return, but patient and submissive.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be to thy menials courteous, and to all</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Placed under thee, considerate and kind:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be never self-indulgent, but avoid</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Excess in pleasure; and, when fortune smiles,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Be not puffed up. Thus to thy husband's house</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wilt thou a blessing prove, and not a curse.</span><br />

you? They are very dear to me.</p>

<p>WARDER.&mdash;If you ask my opinion, Sire, I think the hermits merely wish to
take an opportunity of testifying their loyalty, and are therefore come
to offer homage to your Majesty.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A lonely hermit reared in solitude,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>This throng appears bewildering, and methinks</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I look upon a burning house, whose inmates</span><br />

</div>
<p>S&Aacute;RADWATA.&mdash;It is natural that the first sight of the King's capital

<p>PRIEST [<i>pointing to the King</i>].&mdash;Most reverend sirs, there stands the
protector of the four classes of the people; the guardian of the four
orders of the priesthood. He has just left the judgment-seat, and is
waiting for you. Behold him!</p>

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;Great Br&aacute;hman, we are happy in thinking that the King's
power is exerted for the protection of all classes of his subjects. We
have not come as petitioners&mdash;we have the fullest confidence in the
generosity of his nature.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The loftiest trees bend humbly to the ground</span><br />

<p>WARDER.&mdash;So please your Majesty, I judge from the placid countenance of
the hermits that they have no alarming message to deliver.</p>

<p>KING [<i>looking at &#346;akoontal&aacute;</i>].&mdash;But the lady there&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who can she be, whose form of matchless grace</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like a fresh bud 'mid sear and yellow leaves.</span><br />
</div>
<p>WARDER.&mdash;So please your Majesty, my curiosity is also roused, but no
conjecture occurs to my mind. This at least is certain, that she
deserves to be looked at more closely.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;True; but it is not right to gaze at another man's wife.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>placing her hand on her bosom. Aside</i>].&mdash;O my heart, why
this throbbing? Remember thy lord's affection, and take courage.</p>

<p>PRIEST [<i>advancing</i>].&mdash;These holy men have been received with all due
honor. One of them has now a message to deliver from his spiritual
superior. Will your Majesty deign to hear it?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I am all attention.</p>

<p>HERMITS [<i>extending their hands</i>].&mdash;Victory to the King!</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Accept my respectful greeting.</p>

<p>HERMITS.&mdash;May the desires of your soul be accomplished!</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Such, indeed, is the very meaning of my title&mdash;&quot;Defender of the

interested in his well-being.</p>

<p>HERMITS.&mdash;Holy men have health and prosperity in their own power. He
bade us greet your Majesty, and, after kind inquiries, deliver this
message.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Let me hear his commands.</p>

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;He bade us say that he feels happy in giving his sanction
to the marriage which your Majesty contracted with this lady, his
daughter, privately and by mutual agreement. Because</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By us thou art esteemed the most illustrious</span><br />

</div>

<p>Since, therefore, she expects soon to be the mother of thy child,
receive her into thy palace, that she may perform, in conjunction with
thee, the ceremonies prescribed by religion on such an occasion.</p>

<p>GAUTAM&Iacute;.&mdash;So please your Majesty, I would add a few words: but why
should I intrude my sentiments when an opportunity of speaking my mind
has never been allowed me?</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She took no counsel with her kindred; thou</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Didst not confer with thine, but all alone</span><br />

</div>
<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Ah! how I tremble for my lord's reply.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;What strange proposal is this?</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;His words are fire to me.</p>

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;What do I hear? Dost thou, then, hesitate? Monarch, thou
art well acquainted with the ways of the world, and knowest that</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A wife, however virtuous and discreet,</span><br />

</div>
<p>KING.&mdash;Do you really mean to assert that I ever married this lady?</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>despondingly. Aside</i>].&mdash;O my heart, thy worst misgivings
are confirmed.</p>

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;Is it becoming in a monarch to depart from the rules of
justice, because he repents of his engagements?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I cannot answer a question which is based on a mere fabrication.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;Such inconstancy is fortunately not common, excepting in
men intoxicated by power.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Is that remark aimed at me?</p>

<p>GAUTAM&Iacute;.&mdash;Be not ashamed, my daughter. Let me remove thy veil for a

</div><p><span style='float: right;'>[<i>Remains wrapped in thought.</i></span></p><br />

<p>WARDER.&mdash;How admirably does our royal master's behavior prove his regard
for justice! Who else would hesitate for a moment when good fortune
offered for his acceptance a form of such rare beauty?</p>

<p>S&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;Great King, why art thou silent?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Holy men, I have revolved the matter in my mind; but the more I
think of it, the less able am I to recollect that I ever contracted an
alliance with this lady. What answer, then, can I possibly give you when
I do not believe myself to be her husband, and I plainly see that she is
soon to become a mother?</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Woe! woe! Is our very marriage to be called in
question by my own husband? Ah me! is this to be the end of all my
bright visions of wedded happiness?</p>

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;Beware!</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beware how thou insult the holy Sage!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Remember how he generously allowed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy secret union with his foster-child;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And how, when thou didst rob him of his treasure,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He sought to furnish thee excuse, when rather</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He should have cursed thee for a ravisher.</span><br />
</div>

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RADWATA.&mdash;&#346;&aacute;rngarava, speak to him no more. &#346;akoontal&aacute;, our part is
performed; we have said all we had to say, and the King has replied in
the manner thou hast heard. It is now thy turn to give him convincing
evidence of thy marriage.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Since his feeling towards me has undergone a
complete revolution, what will it avail to revive old recollections? One
thing is clear&mdash;I shall soon have to mourn my own widowhood. [<i>Aloud</i>.]
My revered husband&mdash;[<i>Stops short</i>.] But no&mdash;I dare not address thee by
this title, since thou hast refused to acknowledge our union. Noble
descendant of Puru! It is not worthy of thee to betray an
innocent-minded girl, and disown her in such terms, after having so
lately and so solemnly plighted thy vows to her in the hermitage.</p>

<p>KING [<i>stopping his ears</i>].&mdash;I will hear no more. Be such a crime far
from my thoughts!</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What evil spirit can possess thee, lady,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That, leaping from its narrow bed, overthrows</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The tree upon its bank, and strives to blend</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Its turbid waters with the crystal stream?</span><br />
</div>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;If, then, thou really believest me to be the wife of
another, and thy present conduct proceeds from some cloud that obscures
thy recollection, I will easily convince thee by this token.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;An excellent idea!</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>feeling for the ring</i>].&mdash;Alas! alas! woe is me! There is no
ring on my finger!<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Looks with anguish at Gautam&iacute;</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>GAUTAM&Iacute;.&mdash;The ring must have slipped off when thou wast in the act of
offering homage to the holy water of &#346;ach&iacute;'s sacred pool, near
&#346;akr&aacute;vat&aacute;ra.</p>

<p>KING [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;People may well talk of the readiness of woman's
invention! Here is an instance of it.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Say, rather, of the omnipotence of fate. I will mention
another circumstance, which may yet convince thee.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;By all means let me hear it at once.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;One day, while we were seated in a jasmine bower, thou
didst pour into the hollow of thine hand some water, sprinkled by a
recent shower in the cup of a lotus blossom&mdash;</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I am listening; proceed.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;At that instant, my adopted child, the little fawn, with
soft, long eyes, came running towards us. Upon which, before tasting the
water thyself, thou didst kindly offer some to the little creature,
saying fondly&mdash;&quot;Drink first, gentle fawn.&quot; But she could not be induced
to drink from the hand of a stranger; though immediately afterwards,
when I took the water in my own hand, she drank with perfect confidence.
Then, with a smile, thou didst say&mdash;&quot;Every creature confides naturally
in its own kind. You are both inhabitants of the same forest, and have
learnt to trust each other.&quot;</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Voluptuaries may allow themselves to be seduced from the path of
duty by falsehoods such as these, expressed in honeyed words.</p>

<p>GAUTAM&Iacute;.&mdash;Speak not thus, illustrious Prince. This lady was brought up
in a hermitage, and has never learnt deceit.</p>

thine own evil heart. Thou, at least, art unrivalled in perfidy, and
standest alone&mdash;a base deceiver in the garb of virtue and religion&mdash;like
a deep pit whose yawning mouth is concealed by smiling flowers.</p>

<p>KING [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Her anger, at any rate, appears genuine, and makes me
almost doubt whether I am in the right. For, indeed,</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her brows, that met before in graceful curves,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like the arched weapon of the god of love,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seemed by her frown dissevered; while the fire</span><br />

</div>
<p>[<i>Aloud</i>.] My good lady, Dushyanta's character is well-known to all. I
comprehend not your meaning.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Well do I deserve to be thought a harlot for having, in the
innocence of my heart, and out of the confidence I reposed in a Prince
of Puru's race, intrusted my honor to a man whose mouth distils honey,
while his heart is full of poison.<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Covers her face with her mantle, and bursts into tears</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA.&mdash;Thus is it that burning remorse must ever follow rash

self to blame.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Not hastily should marriage be contracted,</span><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;How now! Do you give credence to this woman rather than to me,
that you heap such accusations on me?</p>

<p>&#346;&Aacute;RNGARAVA [<i>sarcastically</i>].&mdash;That would be too absurd, certainly. You

<h4>Scene.&mdash;A Street</h4>
<br />

<p><i>Enter the King's brother-in-law as Superintendent of the city police;
and with him two Constables, dragging a poor fisherman, who has his
hands tied behind his back</i>.</p>

<p>BOTH THE CONSTABLES [<i>striking the prisoner</i>].&mdash;Take that for a rascally
thief that you are; and now tell us, sirrah, where you found this
ring&mdash;aye, the King's own signet-ring. See, here is the royal name
engraved on the setting of the jewel.</p>

<p>FISHERMAN [<i>with a gesture of alarm</i>].&mdash;Mercy! kind sirs, mercy! I did
not steal it; indeed I did not.</p>

<p>FIRST CONSTABLE.&mdash;Oh! then I suppose the King took you for some fine
Br&aacute;hman, and made you a present of it?</p>

<p>FISHERMAN.&mdash;Only hear me. I am but a poor fisherman, living at
&#346;akr&aacute;vat&aacute;ra&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>SECOND CONSTABLE.&mdash;Scoundrel, who ever asked you, pray, for a history of
your birth and parentage?</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT [<i>to one of the Constables</i>].&mdash;S&uacute;chaka, let the fellow
tell his own story from the beginning. Don't interrupt him.</p>

<p>BOTH CONSTABLES.&mdash;As you please, master. Go on, then, sirrah, and say
what you've got to say.</p>

<p>FISHERMAN.&mdash;You see in me a poor man, who supports his family by
catching fish with nets, hooks, and the like.</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT [<i>laughing</i>].&mdash;A most refined occupation, certainly!</p>

<p>FISHERMAN.&mdash;Blame me not for it, master.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The father's occupation, though despised</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By others, casts no shame upon the son,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And he should not forsake it. Is the priest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who kills the animal for sacrifice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Therefore deemed cruel? Sure a lowborn man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May, though a fisherman, be tender-hearted.</span><br />
</div>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT.&mdash;Well, well; go on with your story.</p>

<p>FISHERMAN.&mdash;One day I was cutting open a large carp I had just hooked,
when the sparkle of a jewel caught my eye, and what should I find in the
fish's maw but that ring! Soon afterwards, when I was offering it for
sale, I was seized by your honors. Now you know everything. Whether you
kill me, or whether you let me go, this is the true account of how the
ring came into my possession.</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT [<i>to one of the Constables</i>].&mdash;Well, J&aacute;nuka, the rascal
emits such a fishy odor that I have no doubt of his being a fisherman;
but we must inquire a little more closely into this queer story about
the finding of the ring. Come, we'll take him before the King's
household.</p>

<p>BOTH CONSTABLES.&mdash;Very good, master. Get on with you, you cutpurse.<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>All move on</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>SUPERINTENDENT.&mdash;Now attend, S&uacute;chaka; keep you guard here at the gate;
and hark ye, sirrahs, take good care your prisoner does not escape,
while I go in and lay the whole story of the discovery of this ring
before the King in person. I will soon return and let you know his
commands.</p>

<p>CONSTABLE.&mdash;Go in, master, by all means; and may you find favor in the
King's sight!<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Exit Superintendent</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>FIRST CONSTABLE [<i>after an interval</i>].&mdash;I say, J&aacute;nuka, the
Superintendent is a long time away.</p>

<p>SECOND CONSTABLE.&mdash;Aye, aye; kings are not to be got at so easily. Folks
must bide the proper opportunity.</p>

<p>FIRST CONSTABLE.&mdash;J&aacute;nuka, my fingers itch to strike the first blow at
this royal victim here. We must kill him with all the honors, you know.
I long to begin binding the flowers round his head.<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Pretends to strike a blow at the fisherman</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>FISHERMAN.&mdash;Your honor surely will not put an innocent man to a cruel
death.</p>

<p>SECOND CONSTABLE [<i>looking</i>].&mdash;There's our Superintendent at last, I
declare. See, he is coming towards us with a paper in his hand. We shall
soon know the King's command; so prepare, my fine fellow, either to
become food for the vultures, or to make acquaintance with some hungry
cur.</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT [<i>entering</i>].&mdash;Ho, there, S&uacute;chaka! set the fisherman at
liberty, I tell you. His story about the ring is all correct.</p>

<p>S&Uacute;CHAKA.&mdash;Oh! very good, sir; as you please.</p>

<p>SECOND CONSTABLE.&mdash;The fellow had one foot in hell, and now here he is
in the land of the living.          <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Releases him</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>FISHERMAN [<i>bowing to the Superintendent</i>].&mdash;Now, master, what think you
of my way of getting a livelihood?</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT.&mdash;Here, my good man, the King desired me to present you
with this purse. It contains a sum of money equal to the full value of
the ring.<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Gives him the money</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>FISHERMAN [<i>taking it and bowing</i>].&mdash;His Majesty does me too great
honor.</p>

<p>S&Uacute;CHAKA.&mdash;You may well say so. He might as well have taken you from the
gallows to seat you on his state elephant.</p>

<p>J&Aacute;NUKA.&mdash;Master, the King must value the ring very highly, or he would
never have sent such a sum of money to this ragamuffin.</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT.&mdash;I don't think he prizes it as a costly jewel so much as
a memorial of some person he tenderly loves. The moment it was shown to
him he became much agitated, though in general he conceals his feelings.</p>

<p>S&Uacute;CHAKA.&mdash;Then you must have done a great service&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>J&Aacute;NUKA.&mdash;Yes, to this husband of a fish-wife.<br />
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Looks enviously at the fisherman</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>FISHERMAN.&mdash;Here's half the money for you, my masters. It will serve to
purchase the flowers you spoke of, if not to buy me your good-will.</p>

<p>J&Aacute;NUKA.&mdash;Well, now, that's just as it should be.</p>

<p>SUPERINTENDENT.&mdash;My good fisherman, you are an excellent fellow, and I
begin to feel quite a regard for you. Let us seal our first friendship
over a glass of good liquor. Come along to the next wine-shop and we'll
drink your health.</p>

<p>ALL.&mdash;By all means.

<h4>Scene.&mdash;The Garden of the Palace</h4>
<br />

<p><i>The nymph S&aacute;numat&iacute; is seen descending in a celestial car</i>.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute;.&mdash;Behold me just arrived from attending in my proper turn at
the nymphs' pool, where I have left the other nymphs to perform their
ablutions, whilst I seek to ascertain, with my own eyes, how it fares
with King Dushyanta. My connection with the nymph Menak&aacute; has made her
daughter &#346;akoontal&aacute; dearer to me than my own flesh and blood; and Menak&aacute;
it was who charged me with this errand on her daughter's behalf.
[<i>Looking round in all directions</i>.] How is it that I see no
preparations in the King's household for celebrating the great vernal
festival? I could easily discover the reason by my divine faculty of
meditation; but respect must be shown to the wishes of my friend. How
then shall I arrive at the truth? I know what I will do. I will become
invisible, and place myself near those two maidens who are tending the
plants in the garden.          <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Descends and takes her station</i>.</span></p><br />

<p><i>Enter a Maiden, who stops in front of a mango-tree and gazes at the
blossom. Another Maiden is seen behind her</i>.</p>

<p>FIRST MAIDEN.&mdash;Hail to thee, lovely harbinger of spring! The varied
radiance of thy opening flowers Is welcome to my sight. I bid thee hail,
Sweet mango, soul of this enchanting season.</p>

<p>SECOND MAIDEN.&mdash;Parabaitik&aacute;, what are you saying there to yourself?</p>

<p>FIRST MAIDEN.&mdash;Dear Madhukarik&aacute;, am I not named after the K&ouml;il?<a name="FNanchor41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> and
does not the K&ouml;il sing for joy at the first appearance of the
mango-blossom?</p>

<p>SECOND MAIDEN [<i>approaching hastily, with transport</i>].&mdash;What! is spring
really come?</p>

<p>FIRST MAIDEN.&mdash;Yes, indeed, Madhukarik&aacute;, and with it the season of joy,
love, and song.</p>

<p>SECOND MAIDEN.&mdash;Let me lean upon you, dear, while I stand on tip-toe and
pluck a blossom of the mango, that I may present it as an offering to
the god of love.</p>

<p>FIRST MAIDEN.&mdash;Provided you let me have half the reward which the god
will bestow in return.</p>

<p>SECOND MAIDEN.&mdash;To be sure you shall, and that without asking. Are we
not one in heart and soul, though divided in body? [<i>Leans on her friend
and plucks a mango-blossom.</i>] Ah! here is a bud just bursting into
flower. It diffuses a delicious perfume, though not yet quite expanded.
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Joining her hands reverentially</i>.</span></p><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>God of the bow, who with spring's choicest flowers</span><br />

</div>
<p><span style='float: right;'>[<i>Throws down a mango-blossom.</i></span></p><br />

<p>CHAMBERLAIN [<i>entering in a hurried manner, angrily</i>].&mdash;Hold there,
thoughtless woman. What are you about breaking off those mango-blossoms,
when the King has forbidden the celebration of the spring festival?</p>

<p>BOTH MAIDENS [<i>alarmed</i>].&mdash;Pardon us, kind sir, we have heard nothing of
it.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN.&mdash;You have heard nothing of it? Why, all the vernal plants
and shrubs, and the very birds that lodge in their branches, show more
respect to the King's order than you do.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yon mango-blossoms, though long since expanded,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gather no down upon their tender crests;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The flower still lingers in the amaranth,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Imprisoned in its bud; the tuneful K&ouml;il,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though winter's chilly dews be overpast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Suspends the liquid volume of his song</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scarce uttered in his throat; e'en Love, dismayed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Restores the half-drawn arrow to his quiver.</span><br />
</div>

<p>BOTH MAIDENS.&mdash;The mighty power of King Dushyanta is not to be disputed.</p>

<p>FIRST MAIDEN.&mdash;It is but a few days since Mitr&aacute;vasu, the king's
brother-in-law, sent us to wait upon his Majesty; and, during the whole
of our sojourn here, we have been intrusted with the charge of the royal
pleasure-grounds. We are therefore strangers in this place, and heard
nothing of the order until you informed us of it.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN.&mdash;Well then, now you know it, take care you don't continue
your preparations.</p>

<p>BOTH MAIDENS.&mdash;But tell us, kind sir, why has the King prohibited the
usual festivities? We are curious to hear, if we may.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Men are naturally fond of festive entertainments.
There must be some good reason for the prohibition.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN.&mdash;The whole affair is now public; why should I not speak of
it! Has not the gossip about the King's rejection of &#346;akoontal&aacute; reached
your ears yet?</p>

<p>BOTH MAIDENS.&mdash;Oh yes, we heard the story from the King's
brother-in-law, as far, at least, as the discovery of the ring.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN.&mdash;Then there is little more to tell you. As soon as the
King's memory was restored by the sight of his own ring, he exclaimed,
&quot;Yes, it is all true. I remember now my secret marriage with &#346;akoontal&aacute;.
When I repudiated her, I had lost my recollection.&quot; Ever since that
moment, he has yielded himself a prey to the bitterest remorse.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He loathes his former pleasures; he rejects</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The daily homage of his ministers.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>On his lone couch he tosses to and fro,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Courting repose in vain. Whene'er he meets</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The ladies of his palace, and would fain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Address them with politeness, he confounds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their names; or, calling them &quot;&#346;akoontal&aacute;,&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is straightway silent and abashed with shame.</span><br />
</div>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;To me this account is delightful.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN.&mdash;In short, the King is so completely out of his mind that
the festival has been prohibited.</p>

<p>BOTH MAIDENS.&mdash;Perfectly right.</p>

<p>A VOICE [<i>behind the scenes</i>].&mdash;The King! the King! This way, Sire, this
way.</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN [<i>listening</i>].&mdash;Oh! here comes his majesty in this
direction. Pass on, maidens; attend to your duties.</p>

<p>BOTH MAIDENS.&mdash;We will, sir. <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p><br />

<p><i>Enter King Dushyanta, dressed in deep mourning, attended by his Jester,
M&aacute;thavya, and preceded by Vetravat&iacute;.</i></p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN [<i>gazing at the King</i>].&mdash;Well, noble forms are certainly
pleasing, under all varieties of outward circumstances. The King's
person is as charming as ever, notwithstanding his sorrow of mind.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though but a single golden bracelet spans</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His wasted arm; though costly ornaments</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Have given place to penitential weeds;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though oft-repeated sighs have blanched his lips,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And robbed them of their bloom; though sleepless care</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And carking thought have dimmed his beaming eye;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet does his form, by its inherent lustre,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dazzle the gaze; and, like a priceless gem</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Committed to some cunning polisher,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Grow more effulgent by the loss of substance.</span><br />
</div>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside. Looking at the King</i>].&mdash;Now that I have seen him, I
can well understand why &#346;akoontal&aacute; should pine after such a man, in
spite of his disdainful rejection of her.</p>

<p>KING [<i>walking slowly up and down, in deep thought</i>].&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When fatal lethargy overwhelmed my soul,</span><br />

&#346;akoontal&aacute; fever. How shall we ever cure him?</p>

<p>CHAMBERLAIN [<i>approaching</i>].&mdash;Victory to the King! Great Prince, the
royal pleasure-grounds have been put in order. Your Majesty can resort
to them for exercise and amusement whenever you think proper.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Vetravat&iacute;, tell the worthy Pi&#347;una, my prime minister, from me,
that I am so exhausted by want of sleep that I cannot sit on the
judgment-seat to-day. If any case of importance be brought before the
tribunal he must give it his best attention, and inform me of the
circumstances by letter.</p>

<p>VETRAVAT&Iacute;.&mdash;Your Majesty's commands shall be obeyed. <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Exit.</i></span></p><br />

<p>KING [<i>to the Chamberlain</i>].&mdash;And you, V&aacute;t&aacute;yana, may go about your own

<p>CHAMBERLAIN.&mdash;I will, Sire. <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Exit.</i></span></p><br />

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Now that you have rid yourself of these troublesome fellows,
you can enjoy the delightful coolness of your pleasure-grounds without
interruption.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Ah! my dear friend, there is an old adage&mdash;&quot;When affliction has a
mind to enter, she will find a crevice somewhere&quot;&mdash;and it is verified in
me.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Scarce is my soul delivered from the cloud</span><br />

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Well, then, wait a moment; I will soon demolish Master K&aacute;ma's
arrow with a cut of my cane.
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Raises his stick and strikes off the mango-blossom.</i></span></p><br />

<p>KING [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;That will do. I see very well the god of Love is not
a match for a Br&aacute;hman. And now, my dear friend, where shall I sit down,
that I may enchant my sight by gazing on the twining plants, which seem
to remind me of the graceful shape of my beloved?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Do you not remember? you told Chaturik&aacute; you should pass the
heat of the day in the jasmine bower; and commanded her to bring the
likeness of your queen &#346;akoontal&aacute;, sketched with your own hand.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;True. The sight of her picture will refresh my soul. Lead the way
to the arbor.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;This way, Sire.
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Both move on, followed by S&aacute;numat&iacute;.</i></span></p><br />

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Here we are at the jasmine bower. Look, it has a marble seat,
and seems to bid us welcome with its offerings of delicious flowers. You
have only to enter and sit down. <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Both enter and seat themselves.</i></span></p><br />

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;I will lean against these young jasmines. I can
easily, from behind them, glance at my friend's picture, and will then
hasten to inform her of her husband's ardent affection.
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Stands leaning against the creepers</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;Oh! my dear friend, how vividly all the circumstances of my union
with &#346;akoontal&aacute; present themselves to my recollection at this moment!
But tell me now how it was that, between the time of my leaving her in
the hermitage and my subsequent rejection of her, you never breathed her
name to me! True, you were not by my side when I disowned her; but I had
confided to you the story of my love and you were acquainted with every
particular. Did it pass out of your mind as it did out of mine?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;No, no; trust me for that. But, if you remember, when you had
finished telling me about it, you added that I was not to take the story
in earnest, for that you were not really in love with a country girl,
but were only jesting; and I was dull and thick-headed enough to believe
you. But so fate decreed, and there is no help for it.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Exactly.</p>

<p>KING [<i>after deep thought</i>].&mdash;My dear friend, suggest some relief for my
misery.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Come, come, cheer up; why do you give way? Such weakness is
unworthy of you. Great men never surrender themselves to uncontrolled
grief. Do not mountains remain unshaken even in a gale of wind?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;How can I be otherwise than inconsolable, when I call to mind the
agonized demeanor of the dear one on the occasion of my disowning her?</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When cruelly I spurned her from my presence,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She fain had left me; but the young recluse,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stern as the Sage, and with authority</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As from his saintly master, in a voice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That brooked not contradiction, bade her stay.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then through her pleading eyes, bedimmed with tears,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She cast on me one long reproachful look,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Which like a poisoned shaft torments me still.</span><br />
</div>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Alas! such is the force of self-reproach following
a rash action. But his anguish only rejoices me.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;An idea has just struck me. I should not wonder if some
celestial being had carried her off to heaven.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Very likely. Who else would have dared to lay a
finger on a wife, the idol of her husband? It is said that Menak&aacute;, the
nymph of heaven, gave her birth. The suspicion has certainly crossed my
mind that some of her celestial companions may have taken her to their
own abode.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;His present recollection of every circumstance of
her history does not surprise me so much as his former forgetfulness.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;If that's the case, you will be certain to meet her before
long.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Why?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;No father and mother can endure to see a daughter suffering
the pain of separation from her husband.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Oh! my dear M&aacute;thavya,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was it a dream? or did some magic dire,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dulling my senses with a strange delusion,</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Jealous of my good actions, mar their fruit,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And rob me of their guerdon? It is past,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Whatever the spell that bound me. Once again</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Am I awake, but only to behold</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The precipice o'er which my hopes have fallen.</span><br />
</div>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Do not despair in this manner. Is not this very ring a proof
that what has been lost may be unexpectedly found?</p>

<p>KING [<i>gazing at the ring</i>].&mdash;Ah! this ring, too, has fallen from a
station which it will not easily regain, and deserves all my sympathy.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Had it found its way to the hand of any other
person, then indeed its fate would have been deplorable.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Pray, how did the ring ever come upon her hand at all?</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute;.&mdash;I myself am curious to know.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;You shall hear. When I was leaving my beloved &#346;akoontal&aacute; that I
might return to my own capital, she said to me, with tears in her eyes,
&quot;How long will it be ere my lord send for me to his palace and make me
his queen?&quot;</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Well, what was your reply?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Then I placed the ring on her finger, and thus addressed her&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Repeat each day one letter of the name</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shall come to lead thee to thy husband's palace.</span><br />
</div><p>But, hard-hearted man that I was, I forgot to fulfil my promise, owing
to the infatuation that took possession of me.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;A pleasant arrangement! Fate, however, ordained
that the appointment should not be kept.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;But how did the ring contrive to pass into the stomach of
that carp which the fisherman caught and was cutting up?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;It must have slipped from my &#346;akoontal&aacute;'s hand, and fallen into
the stream of the Ganges, while she was offering homage to the water of
Sach&iacute;'s holy pool.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Very likely.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Hence it happened, I suppose, that the King, always
fearful of committing the least injustice, came to doubt his marriage
with my poor &#346;akoontal&aacute;. But why should affection so strong as his stand
in need of any token of recognition?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Let me now address a few words of reproof to this ring.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;He is going stark mad, I verily believe.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Hear me, thou dull and undiscerning bauble!</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For so it argues thee, that thou couldst leave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The slender fingers of her hand, to sink</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beneath the waters. Yet what marvel is it</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That thou shouldst lack discernment? let me rather</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Heap curses on myself, who, though endowed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With reason, yet rejected her I loved.</span><br />
</div>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;And so, I suppose, I must stand here to be devoured
by hunger, whilst he goes on in this sentimental strain.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;O forsaken one, unjustly banished from my presence, take pity on
thy slave, whose heart is consumed by the fire of remorse, and return to
my sight.</p>

<p><i>Enter Chaturik&aacute; hurriedly, with a picture in her hand</i>.</p>

<p>CHATURIK&Aacute;.&mdash;Here is the Queen's portrait. <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Shows the picture</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Excellent, my dear friend, excellent! The imitation of nature
is perfect, and the attitude of the figures is really charming. They
stand out in such bold relief that the eye is quite deceived.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;A most artistic performance! I admire the King's
skill, and could almost believe that &#346;akoontal&aacute; herself was before me.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I own 'tis not amiss, though it portrays</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But feebly her angelic loveliness.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Aught less than perfect is depicted falsely,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And fancy must supply the imperfection.</span><br />
</div>
<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;A very just remark from a modest man, whose
affection is exaggerated by the keenness of his remorse.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Tell me&mdash;I see three female figures drawn on the canvas, and
all of them beautiful; which of the three is her Majesty, &#346;akoontal&aacute;?</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;If he cannot distinguish her from the others, the
simpleton might as well have no eyes in his head.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Which should you imagine to be intended for her?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;She who is leaning, apparently a little tired, against the
stem of that mango-tree, the tender leaves of which glitter with the
water she has poured upon them. Her arms are gracefully extended; her
face is somewhat flushed with the heat; and a few flowers have escaped
from her hair, which has become unfastened, and hangs in loose tresses
about her neck. That must be the queen &#346;akoontal&aacute;, and the others, I
presume, are her two attendants.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I congratulate you on your discernment. Behold the proof of my
passion;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My finger, burning with the glow of love,</span><br />

<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Takes the picture. Exit Chaturik&aacute;</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;My loved one came but lately to my presence</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And offered me herself, but in my folly</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I spurned the gift, and now I fondly cling</span><br />

which I purposed to draw, but find I have omitted.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;What is that?</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Something suitable, I suppose, to the simple attire
of a young and beautiful girl dwelling in a forest.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;Pray, why does the Queen cover her lips with the tips of her
fingers, bright as the blossom of a lily, as if she were afraid of
something? [<i>Looking more closely</i>.] Oh! I see; a vagabond bee, intent
on thieving the honey of flowers, has mistaken her mouth for a rose-bud,
and is trying to settle upon it.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;A bee! drive off the impudent insect, will you?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;That's your business. Your royal prerogative gives you power
over all offenders.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Very true. Listen to me, thou favorite guest of flowering plants;
why give thyself the trouble of hovering here? See where thy partner
sits on yonder flower, And waits for thee ere she will sip its dew.</p>

<p>S&Aacute;NUMAT&Iacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;A most polite way of warning him off!</p>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;You'll find the obstinate creature is not to be sent about

talk almost as wildly. [<i>Aloud</i>.] Look, it is only a painted bee.</p>

he was childless; and the whole of his immense property becomes by law

childlessness. But surely, if he was wealthy, he must have had many
wives. Let an inquiry be made whether any one of them is expecting to
give birth to a child.</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Appoints thee to the post of highest honor,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As leader of his armies; and commits</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The subjugation of this giant brood</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To thy resistless arms, e'en as the sun</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Leaves the pale moon to dissipate the darkness.</span><br />
</div>
<p>Let your Majesty, therefore, ascend at once the celestial car of Indra;
and, grasping your arms, advance to victory.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;The mighty Indra honors me too highly by such a mark of
distinction. But tell me, what made you act thus towards my poor friend
M&aacute;thavya?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;I will tell you. Perceiving that your Majesty's spirit was
completely broken by some distress of mind under which you were
laboring, I determined to rouse your energies by moving you to anger.
Because</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The cobra, when incensed, extends his head</span>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Display their courage only when provoked.</span>
</div>

<p>KING [<i>aside to M&aacute;thavya</i>].&mdash;My dear M&aacute;thavya, the commands of the great
Indra must not be left unfulfilled. Go you and acquaint my minister,
Pi&#347;una, with what has happened, and say to him from me, Dushyanta to thy
care confides his realm&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Protect with all the vigor of thy mind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The interests of my people; while my bow</span><br />

</div>

<p>M&Aacute;THAVYA.&mdash;I obey.         <span style='float: right;'> [<i>Exit.</i></span></p><br />

<br />

<p><i>Enter King Dushyanta and M&aacute;tali in the car of Indra, moving in the
air</i>.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;My good M&aacute;tali, it appears to me incredible that I can merit such
a mark of distinction for having simply fulfilled the behests of the
great Indra.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;Great Prince, it seems to me that neither of you is
satisfied with himself&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>You underrate the service you have rendered,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And think too highly of the god's reward:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He deems it scarce sufficient recompense</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For your heroic deeds on his behalf.</span><br />
</div>

<p>KING.&mdash;Nay, M&aacute;tali, say not so. My most ambitious expectations were more
than realized by the honor conferred on me at the moment when I took my
leave. For,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tinged with celestial sandal, from the breast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the great Indra, where before it hung,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A garland of the ever-blooming tree</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Nandana was cast about my neck</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By his own hand: while, in the very presence</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the assembled gods, I was enthroned</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beside their mighty lord, who smiled to see</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His son Jayanta envious of the honor.</span><br />
</div>
<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;There is no mark of distinction which your Majesty does not
deserve at the hands of the immortals. See,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Heaven's hosts acknowledge thee their second saviour;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For now thy bow's unerring shafts (as erst</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The lion-man's terrific claws) have purged</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The empyreal sphere from taint of demons foul.</span><br />
</div>

<p>KING.&mdash;The praise of my victory must be ascribed to the majesty of
Indra.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When mighty gods make men their delegates</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In martial enterprise, to them belongs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The palm of victory; and not to mortals.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Could the pale Dawn dispel the shades of night,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Did not the god of day, whose diadem</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is jewelled with a thousand beams of light,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Place him in front of his effulgent car?</span><br />
</div>
<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;A very just comparison. [<i>Driving on.</i>] Great King, behold! the
glory of thy fame has reached even to the vault of heaven.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Hark! yonder inmates of the starry sphere</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sing anthems worthy of thy martial deeds,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>While with celestial colors they depict</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The story of thy victories on scrolls</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Formed of the leaves of heaven's immortal trees.</span><br />
</div>
<p>KING.&mdash;My good M&aacute;tali, yesterday, when I ascended the sky, I was so
eager to do battle with the demons, that the road by which we were
travelling towards Indra's heaven escaped my observation. Tell me, in
which path of the seven winds are we now moving?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;We journey in the path of Parivaha;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The wind that bears along the triple Ganges,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And causes Ursa's seven stars to roll</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In their appointed orbits, scattering</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their several rays with equal distribution.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>'Tis the same path that once was sanctified</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By the divine impression of the foot</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Vishnu, when, to conquer haughty Bali,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He spanned the heavens in his second stride.</span><br />
</div>
<p>KING.&mdash;This is the reason, I suppose, that a sensation of calm repose
pervades all my senses. [<i>Looking down at the wheels.</i>] Ah! M&aacute;tali, we
are descending towards the earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;What makes you think so?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;The car itself instructs me; we are moving</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O'er pregnant clouds, surcharged with rain; below us</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I see the moisture-loving Ch&aacute;takas</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In sportive flight dart through the spokes; the steeds</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of Indra glisten with the lightning's flash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And a thick mist bedews the circling wheels.</span><br />
</div>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;You are right; in a little while the chariot will touch the
ground, and you will be in your own dominions.</p>

<p>KING [<i>looking down</i>],&mdash;How wonderful is the appearance of the earth as
we rapidly descend!</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stupendous prospect! yonder lofty hills</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Do suddenly uprear their towering heads</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Amid the plain, while from beneath their crests</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The ground receding sinks; the trees, whose stems</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seemed lately hid within their leafy tresses,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Rise into elevation, and display</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Their branching shoulders; yonder streams, whose waters,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like silver threads, but now were scarcely seen,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Grow into mighty rivers; lo! the earth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Seems upward hurled by some gigantic power.</span><br />
</div>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;Well described! [<i>Looking with awe.</i>] Grand, indeed, and lovely
is the spectacle presented by the earth.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Tell me, M&aacute;tali, what is that range of mountains which, like a
bank of clouds illumined by the setting sun, pours down a stream of
gold? On one side its base dips into the eastern ocean, and on the other
side into the western.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;Great Prince, it is called &quot;Golden-peak,&quot;<a name="FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and is the abode
of the attendants of the god of Wealth. In this spot the highest forms
of penance are wrought out.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>There Ka&#347;yapa, the great progenitor</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of demons and of gods, himself the offspring</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the divine Mar&iacute;chi, Brahm&aacute;'s son,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With Aditi, his wife, in calm seclusion,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Does holy penance for the good of mortals.</span><br />
</div>

<p>KING.&mdash;Then I must not neglect so good an opportunity of obtaining his
blessing. I should much like to visit this venerable personage and offer
him my homage.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;By all means! An excellent idea. [<i>Guides the car to the
earth.</i>]</p>

<p>KING [<i>in a tone of wonder</i>].&mdash;How's this?</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our chariot wheels move noiselessly. Around</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No clouds of dust arise; no shock betokened</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Our contact with the earth; we seem to glide</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Above the ground, so lightly do we touch it.</span><br />
</div>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;Such is the difference between the car of Indra and that of
your Majesty.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;In which direction, M&aacute;tali, is Ka&#347;yapa's sacred retreat?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI [<i>pointing</i>].&mdash;Where stands yon anchorite, towards the orb</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of the meridian sun, immovable</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As a tree's stem, his body half-concealed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By a huge ant-hill. Round about his breast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No sacred cord is twined, but in its stead</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A hideous serpent's skin. In place of necklace,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The tendrils of a withered creeper chafe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His wasted neck. His matted hair depends</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In thick entanglement about his shoulders,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And birds construct their nests within its folds.</span><br />
</div>

<p>KING.&mdash;I salute thee, thou man of austere devotion.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI [<i>holding in the reins of the car</i>].&mdash;Great Prince, we are now in
the sacred grove of the holy Ka&#347;yapa&mdash;the grove that boasts as its
ornament one of the five trees of Indra's heaven, reared by Aditi.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;This sacred retreat is more delightful than heaven itself. I
could almost fancy myself bathing in a pool of nectar.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI [<i>stopping the chariot</i>].&mdash;Descend, mighty Prince.</p>

<p>KING [<i>descending</i>].&mdash;And what will you do, M&aacute;tali?</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;The chariot will remain where I have stopped it. We may both
descend. [<i>Doing so.</i>] This way, great King, [<i>Walking on.</i>] You see
around you the celebrated region where the holiest sages devote
themselves to penitential rites.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I am filled with awe and wonder as I gaze.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In such a place as this do saints of earth</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Long to complete their acts of penance; here,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beneath the shade of everlasting trees,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Transplanted from the groves of Paradise,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May they inhale the balmy air, and need</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No other nourishment; here may they bathe</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In fountains sparkling with the golden dust</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of lilies; here, on jewelled slabs of marble,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In meditation rapt, may they recline;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here, in the presence of celestial nymphs,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>E'en passion's voice is powerless to move them.</span><br />
</div>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;So true is it that the aspirations of the good and great are
ever soaring upwards. [<i>Turning round and speaking off the stage</i>.] Tell
me, Vriddha-&#347;&aacute;kalya, how is the divine son of Mar&iacute;chi now engaged? What
sayest thou? that he is conversing with Aditi and some of the wives of
the great sages, and that they are questioning him respecting the duties
of a faithful wife?</p>

<p>KING [<i>listening</i>].&mdash;Then we must await the holy father's leisure.</p>

<p>M&Aacute;TALI [<i>looking at the King</i>].&mdash;If your Majesty will rest under the
shade, at the foot of this A&#347;oka-tree, I will seek an opportunity of
announcing your arrival to Indra's reputed father.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;As you think proper.          <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Remains under the tree</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;Great King, I go.         <span style='float: right;'> [<i>Exit.</i></span></p><br />

<p>KING [<i>feeling his arm throb</i>].&mdash;Wherefore this causeless throbbing, O
mine arm?</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>All hope has fled forever; mock me not</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With presages of good, when happiness</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is lost, and nought but misery remains.</span><br />
</div>

<p>A VOICE [<i>behind the scenes</i>].&mdash;Be not so naughty. Do you begin already
to show a refractory spirit?</p>

<p>KING [<i>listening</i>].&mdash;This is no place for petulance. Who can it be whose
behavior calls for such a rebuke? [<i>Looking in the direction of the
sound and smiling</i>.] A child, is it? closely attended by two holy women.
His disposition seems anything but childlike. See,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He braves the fury of yon lioness</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Suckling its savage offspring, and compels</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The angry whelp to leave the half-sucked dug,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Tearing its tender mane in boisterous sport.</span><br />
</div>

<p><i>Enter a child, attended by two women of the hermitage, in the manner
described</i>.</p>

<p>CHILD.&mdash;Open your mouth, my young lion, I want to count your teeth.</p>

<p>FIRST ATTENDANT.&mdash;You naughty child, why do you tease the animals? Know
you not that we cherish them in this hermitage as if they were our own
children? In good sooth, you have a high spirit of your own, and are
beginning already to do justice to the name Sarva-damana (All-taming),
given you by the hermits.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Strange! My heart inclines towards the boy with almost as much
affection as if he were my own child. What can be the reason? I suppose
my own childlessness makes me yearn towards the sons of others.</p>

<p>SECOND ATTENDANT.&mdash;This lioness will certainly attack you if you do not
release her whelp.</p>

<p>CHILD [<i>laughing</i>].&mdash;Oh! indeed! let her come. Much I fear her, to be
sure.          <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Pouts his under-lip in defiance</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;The germ of mighty courage lies concealed</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Within this noble infant, like a spark</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beneath the fuel, waiting but a breath</span><br />

</div>

<p>FIRST ATTENDANT.&mdash;Let the young lion go, like a dear child, and I will
give you something else to play with.</p>

<p>CHILD.&mdash;Where is it? Give it me first.
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Stretches out his hand.</i></span></p><br />

<p>KING [<i>looking at his hand</i>].&mdash;How's this? His hand exhibits one of
those mystic marks which are the sure prognostic of universal empire.
See!</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His fingers stretched in eager expectation</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To grasp the wished-for toy, and knit together</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A lotus-blossom, whose expanding petals</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The early dawn has only half unfolded.</span><br />
</div>

<p>SECOND ATTENDANT.&mdash;We shall never pacify him by mere words, dear
Suvrat&aacute;. Be kind enough to go to my cottage, and you will find there a
plaything belonging to M&aacute;rk&aacute;ndeya, one of the hermit's children. It is a
peacock made of China-ware, painted in many colors. Bring it here for
the child.</p>

<p>FIRST ATTENDANT.&mdash;Very well.          <span style='float: right;'>[<i>Exit.</i></span></p><br />

<p>CHILD.&mdash;No, no; I shall go on playing with the young lion.
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Looks at the female attendant and laughs</i>.</span></p><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;I feel an unaccountable affection for this wayward child.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How blessed the virtuous parents whose attire</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Is soiled with dust, by raising from the ground</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And happy are they while with lisping prattle,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In accents sweetly inarticulate,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>He charms their ears; and with his artless smiles</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Gladdens their hearts, revealing to their gaze</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His tiny teeth, just budding into view.</span><br />
</div>

<p>ATTENDANT.&mdash;I see how it is. He pays me no manner of attention.
[<i>Looking off the stage.</i>] I wonder whether any of the hermits are about
here. [<i>Seeing the King.</i>] Kind Sir, could you come hither a moment and
help me to release the young lion from the clutch of this child, who is
teasing him in boyish play?</p>

<p>KING [<i>approaching and smiling</i>].&mdash;Listen to me, thou child of a mighty
saint.</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dost thou dare show a wayward spirit here?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here, in this hallowed region? Take thou heed</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou bring dishonor on the holy sage,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy tender-hearted parent, who delights</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To shield from harm the tenants of the wood.</span><br />
</div>

<p>ATTENDANT.&mdash;Gentle Sir, I thank you; but he is not the saint's son.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;His behavior and whole bearing would have led me to doubt it, had
not the place of his abode encouraged the idea.</p>

<p>[<i>Follows the child, and takes him by the hand, according to the request
of the attendant. Speaking aside.</i><br />
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I marvel that the touch of this strange child</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How must the fond caresses of a son</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Transport the father's soul who gave him being!</span><br />
</div>

<p>ATTENDANT [<i>looking at them both</i>].&mdash;Wonderful! Prodigious!</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;What excites your surprise, my good woman?</p>

<p>ATTENDANT.&mdash;I am astonished at the striking resemblance between the
child and yourself; and, what is still more extraordinary, he seems to
have taken to you kindly and submissively, though you are a stranger to
him.</p>

<p>KING [<i>fondling the child</i>].&mdash;If he be not the son of the great sage, of
what family does he come, may I ask?</p>

<p>ATTENDANT.&mdash;Of the race of Puru.</p>

<p>KING [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;What! are we, then, descended from the same ancestry?
This, no doubt, accounts for the resemblance she traces between the
child and me. Certainly it has always been an established usage among
the princes of Puru's race,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To dedicate the morning of their days</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of sacred trees their last asylum, where</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As hermits they may practise self-abasement,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And bind themselves by rigid vows of penance.</span><br />
</div><p>[<i>Aloud.</i>] But how could mortals by their own power gain admission to
this sacred region?</p>

you that his mother is the offspring of a celestial nymph, and gave him
birth in the hallowed grove of Ka&#347;yapa.</p>

<p>BOTH ATTENDANTS.&mdash;Hold! hold! Touch it not, for your life. How
marvellous! He has actually taken it up without the slightest
hesitation.<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Both raise their hands to their breasts and look at each other in
astonishment.</i></span></p><br />

<p>KING.&mdash;Why did you try to prevent my touching it?</p>

<p>FIRST ATTENDANT.&mdash;Listen, great Monarch. This amulet, known as &quot;The
Invincible,&quot; was given to the boy by the divine son of Mar&iacute;chi, soon
after his birth, when the natal ceremony was performed. Its peculiar
virtue is, that when it falls on the ground, no one excepting the father
or mother of the child can touch it unhurt.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;And suppose another person touches it?</p>

<p>FIRST ATTENDANT.&mdash;Then it instantly becomes a serpent, and bites him.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Have you ever witnessed the transformation with your own eyes?</p>

<p>BOTH ATTENDANTS.&mdash;Over and over again.</p>

<p>KING [<i>with rapture. Aside</i>].&mdash;Joy! joy! Are then my dearest hopes to be
fulfilled?<br />

<p>SECOND ATTENDANT.&mdash;Come, my dear Suvrat&aacute;, we must inform &#346;akoontal&aacute;

the performance of her religious vows.<br />

<p>KING.&mdash;We will go to her together, and give her joy, my son.</p>

<p>CHILD.&mdash;Dushyanta is my father, not you.</p>

<p>KING [<i>smiling</i>].&mdash;His contradiction convinces me only the more.</p>

<p><i>Enter &#346;akoontal&aacute;, in widow's apparel, with her long hair twisted into a

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;I have just heard that Sarva-damana's amulet has
retained its form, though a stranger raised it from the ground. I can
hardly believe in my good fortune. Yet why should not S&aacute;numat&iacute;'s
prediction be verified?</p>

<p>KING [<i>gazing at &#346;akoontal&aacute;</i>].&mdash;Alas! can this indeed be my &#346;akoontal&aacute;?</p>

stranger's touch?</p>

<p>CHILD [<i>going to his mother</i>].&mdash;Mother, who is this man that has been
kissing me and calling me his son?</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;My best beloved, I have indeed treated thee most cruelly, but am
now once more thy fond and affectionate lover. Refuse not to acknowledge
me as thy husband.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Be of good cheer, my heart. The anger of Destiny

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute;.&mdash;Rise, my own husband, rise. Thou wast not to blame. My own
evil deeds, committed in a former state of being, brought down this
judgment upon me. How else could my husband, who was ever of a

</div>

<p>KING.&mdash;Most venerable Ka&#347;yapa, by your favor all my desires were
accomplished even before I was admitted to your presence. Never was
mortal so honored that his boon should be granted ere it was solicited.
Because,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Bloom before fruit, the clouds before the rain&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Cause first and then effect, in endless sequence,</span><br />

<p>M&Aacute;TALI.&mdash;It is thus that the great progenitors of the world confer
favors.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Most reverend Sage, this thy handmaid was married to me by the
Gandharva ceremony, and after a time was conducted to my palace by her
relations. Meanwhile a fatal delusion seized me; I lost my memory and
rejected her, thus committing a grievous offence against the venerable
Kanwa, who is of thy divine race. Afterwards the sight of this ring
restored my faculties, and brought back to my mind all the circumstances
of my union with his daughter. But my conduct still seems to me
incomprehensible;</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As foolish as the fancies of a man</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who, when he sees an elephant, denies</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That 'tis an elephant, yet afterwards,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When its huge bulk moves onward, hesitates,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Yet will not be convinced till it has passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Forever from his sight, and left behind</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No vestige of its presence save its footsteps.</span><br />
</div>

<p>KASYAPA.&mdash;My son, cease to think thyself in fault. Even the delusion
that possessed thy mind was not brought about by any act of thine.
Listen to me.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;I am attentive.</p>

<p>KASYAPA.&mdash;Know that when the nymph Menak&aacute;, the mother of &#346;akoontal&aacute;,
became aware of her daughter's anguish in consequence of the loss of the
ring at the nymphs' pool, and of thy subsequent rejection of her, she
brought her and confided her to the care of Aditi. And I no sooner saw
her than I ascertained by my divine power of meditation, that thy
repudiation of thy poor faithful wife had been caused entirely by the
curse of Durv&aacute;sas&mdash;not by thine own fault&mdash;and that the spell would
terminate on the discovery of the ring.</p>

<p>KING [<i>drawing a deep breath</i>].&mdash;Oh! what a weight is taken off my mind,
now that my character is cleared of reproach.</p>

<p>&#346;AKOONTAL&Aacute; [<i>aside</i>].&mdash;Joy! joy! My revered husband did not, then,
reject me without good reason, though I have no recollection of the
curse pronounced upon me. But, in all probability, I unconsciously
brought it upon myself, when I was so distracted on being separated from
my husband soon after our marriage. For I now remember that my two
friends advised me not to fail to show the ring in case he should have
forgotten me.</p>

<p>KA&#346;YAPA.&mdash;At last, my daughter, thou art happy, and hast gained thy
heart's desire. Indulge, then, no feeling of resentment against thy
partner. See, now,</p>
<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Though he repulsed thee, 'twas the sage's curse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That clouded his remembrance; 'twas the curse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That made thy tender husband harsh towards thee.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Soon as the spell was broken, and his soul</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Delivered from its darkness, in a moment</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thou didst gain thine empire o'er his heart.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So on the tarnished surface of a mirror</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No image is reflected, till the dust</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That dimmed its wonted lustre is removed.</span><br />
</div>

<p>KING.&mdash;Holy father, see here the hope of my royal race.
<span style='float: right;'>[<i>Takes his child by the hand</i>.</span></p><br />

Observe,</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The trackless ocean, borne above the waves</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mankind shall hail him as King Bharata,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And call him the supporter of the world.</span><br />
</div>

<p>KING.&mdash;We cannot but entertain the highest hopes of a child for whom
your highness performed the natal rites.</p>

<p>ADITI.&mdash;My revered husband, should not the intelligence be conveyed to
Kanwa, that his daughter's wishes are fulfilled, and her happiness
complete? He is &#346;akoontal&aacute;'s foster-father. Menak&aacute;, who is one of my
attendants, is her mother, and dearly does she love her daughter.</p>

very wish that was in my mind.</p>

<p>KA&#346;YAPA.&mdash;His penances have gained for him the faculty of omniscience,
and the whole scene is already present to his mind's eye.</p>

<p>KING.&mdash;Then most assuredly he cannot be very angry with me.</p>

<p>KA&#346;YAPA.&mdash;Nevertheless it becomes us to send him intelligence of this
happy event, and hear his reply. What, ho there!</p>

<p>PUPIL [<i>entering</i>].&mdash;Holy father, what are your commands?</p>

<p>KA&#346;YAPA.&mdash;My good G&aacute;lava, delay not an instant, but hasten through the
air and convey to the venerable Kanwa, from me, the happy news that the
fatal spell has ceased, that Dushyanta's memory is restored, that his
daughter &#346;akoontal&aacute; has a son, and that she is once more tenderly
acknowledged by her husband.</p>

<h2>TORU DUTT</h2>


<a name='TD_INTRODUCTION'></a><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>If Toru Dutt were alive, she would still be younger than any recognized
European writer, and yet her fame, which is already considerable, has
been entirely posthumous. Within the brief space of four years which now
divides us from the date of her decease, her genius has been revealed to
the world under many phases, and has been recognized throughout France
and England. Her name, at least, is no longer unfamiliar in the ear of
any well-read man or woman. But at the hour of her death she had
published but one book, and that book had found but two reviewers in
Europe. One of these, M. Andr&eacute; Theuriet, the well-known poet and
novelist, gave the &quot;Sheaf gleaned in French Fields&quot; adequate praise in
the &quot;Revue des Deux Mondes&quot;; but the other, the writer of the present
notice, has a melancholy satisfaction in having been a little earlier
still in sounding the only note of welcome which reached the dying
poetess from England. It was while Professor W. Minto was editor of the
&quot;Examiner,&quot; that one day in August, 1876, in the very heart of the dead
season for books, I happened to be in the office of that newspaper, and
was upbraiding the whole body of publishers for issuing no books worth
reviewing. At that moment the postman brought in a thin and sallow
packet with a wonderful Indian postmark on it, and containing a most
unattractive orange pamphlet of verse, printed at Bhowanipore, and
entitled &quot;A Sheaf gleaned in French Fields, by Toru Dutt.&quot; This shabby
little book of some two hundred pages, without preface or introduction,
seemed specially destined by its particular providence to find its way
hastily into the waste-paper basket. I remember that Mr. Minto thrust it
into my unwilling hands, and said &quot;There! see whether you can't make
something of that.&quot; A hopeless volume it seemed, with its queer type,
published at Bhowanipore, printed at the Saptahiksambad Press! But when
at last I took it out of my pocket, what was my surprise and almost
rapture to open at such verse as this:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Still barred thy doors! The far East glows,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The morning wind blows fresh and free.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Should not the hour that wakes the rose</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 6em;'>Awaken also thee?</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;All look for thee, Love, Light, and Song,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Light in the sky deep red above,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Song, in the lark of pinions strong,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 6em;'>And in my heart, true Love.</span><br /></div>
<div class='stanza'>
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Apart we miss our nature's goal,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Why strive to cheat our destinies?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was not my love made for thy soul?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Thy beauty for mine eyes?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 6em;'>No longer sleep,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 7em;'>Oh, listen now!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 6em;'>I wait and weep,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 7em;'>But where art thou?&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>When poetry is as good as this it does not much matter whether Rouveyre
prints it upon Whatman paper, or whether it steals to light in blurred

<p>Toru Dutt was the youngest of the three children of a high-caste Hindoo
couple in Bengal. Her father, who survives them all, the Baboo Govin
Chunder Dutt, is himself distinguished among his countrymen for the
width of his views and the vigor of his intelligence. His only son,
Abju, died in 1865, at the age of fourteen, and left his two younger
sisters to console their parents. Aru, the elder daughter, born in 1854,
was eighteen months senior to Toru, the subject of this memoir, who was
born in Calcutta on March 4, 1856. With the exception of one year's
visit to Bombay, the childhood of these girls was spent in Calcutta, at
their father's garden-house. In a poem now printed for the first time,
Toru refers to the scene of her earliest memories, the circling
wilderness of foliage, the shining tank with the round leaves of the
lilies, the murmuring dusk under the vast branches of the central
casuarina-tree. Here, in a mystical retirement more irksome to a
European in fancy than to an Oriental in reality, the brain of this
wonderful child was moulded. She was pure Hindoo, full of the typical
qualities of her race and blood, and, as the present volume shows us for
the first time, preserving to the last her appreciation of the poetic
side of her ancient religion, though faith itself in Vishnu and Siva had
been cast aside with childish things and been replaced by a purer faith.
Her mother fed her imagination with the old songs and legends of their
people, stories which it was the last labor of her life to weave into
English verse; but it would seem that the marvellous faculties of Toru's
mind still slumbered, when, in her thirteenth year, her father decided
to take his daughters to Europe to learn English and French. To the end
of her days Toru was a better French than English scholar. She loved
France best, she knew its literature best, she wrote its language with
more perfect elegance. The Dutts arrived in Europe at the close of 1869,
and the girls went to school, for the first and last time, at a French
pension. They did not remain there very many months; their father took
them to Italy and England with him, and finally they attended for a
short time, but with great zeal and application, the lectures for women
at Cambridge. In November, 1873, they went back to Bengal, and the four
remaining years of Toru's life were spent in the old garden-house at
Calcutta, in a feverish dream of intellectual effort and imaginative
production. When we consider what she achieved in these forty-five
months of seclusion, it is impossible to wonder that the frail and
hectic body succumbed under so excessive a strain.</p>

<p>She brought with her from Europe a store of knowledge that would have
sufficed to make an English or French girl seem learned, but which in
her case was simply miraculous. Immediately on her return she began to
study Sanscrit with the same intense application which she gave to all
her work, and mastering the language with extraordinary swiftness, she
plunged into its mysterious literature. But she was born to write, and
despairing of an audience in her own language, she began to adopt ours
as a medium for her thought. Her first essay, published when she was
eighteen, was a monograph, in the &quot;Bengal Magazine,&quot; on Leconte de
Lisle, a writer with whom she had a sympathy which is very easy to
comprehend. The austere poet of &quot;La Mort de Valmiki&quot; was, obviously, a
figure to whom the poet of &quot;Sindhu&quot; must needs be attracted on
approaching European literature. This study, which was illustrated by
translations into English verse, was followed by another on Jos&eacute;phin
Soulary, in whom she saw more than her maturer judgment might have
justified. There is something very interesting and now, alas! still more
pathetic in these sturdy and workmanlike essays in unaided criticism.
Still more solitary her work became, in July, 1874, when her only
sister, Aru, died, at the age of twenty. She seems to have been no less
amiable than her sister, and if gifted with less originality and a less
forcible ambition, to have been finely accomplished. Both sisters were
well-trained musicians, with full contralto voices, and Aru had a
faculty for design which promised well. The romance of &quot;Mlle. D'Arvers&quot;
was originally projected for Aru to illustrate, but no page of this book
did Aru ever see.</p>

<p>In 1876, as we have said, appeared that obscure first volume at
Bhowanipore. The &quot;Sheaf gleaned in French Fields&quot; is certainly the most
imperfect of Toru's writings, but it is not the least interesting. It is
a wonderful mixture of strength and weakness, of genius overriding great
obstacles, and of talent succumbing to ignorance and inexperience. That
it should have been performed at all is so extraordinary that we forget
to be surprised at its inequality. The English verse is sometimes
exquisite; at other times the rules of our prosody are absolutely
ignored, and it is obvious that the Hindoo poetess was chanting to
herself a music that is discord in an English ear. The notes are no less
curious, and to a stranger no less bewildering. Nothing could be more
naive than the writer's ignorance at some points, or more startling than
her learning at others. On the whole, the attainment of the book was
simply astounding. It consisted of a selection of translations from
nearly one hundred French poets, chosen by the poetess herself on a
principle of her own which gradually dawned upon the careful reader. She
eschewed the Classicist writers as though they had never existed. For
her Andr&eacute; Chenier was the next name in chronological order after Du
Bartas. Occasionally she showed a profundity of research that would have
done no discredit to Mr. Saintsbury or &quot;le doux Assellineau.&quot; She was
ready to pronounce an opinion on Napol le Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;an or detect a
plagiarism in Baudelaire. But she thought that Alexander Smith was still
alive, and she was curiously vague about the career of Sainte-Beuve.
This inequality of equipment was a thing inevitable to her isolation,
and hardly worthy recording, except to show how laborious her mind was,
and how quick to make the best of small resources.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the &quot;Sheaf gleaned in French Fields&quot; attracted
the very minimum of attention in England. In France it was talked about
a little more. M. Garcin de Tassy, the famous Orientalist, who scarcely
survived Toru by twelve months, spoke of it to Mlle. Clarisse Bader,
author of a somewhat remarkable book on the position of women in ancient
Indian society. Almost simultaneously this volume fell into the hands of
Toru, and she was moved to translate it into English, for the use of
Hindoos less instructed than herself. In January, 1877, she accordingly
wrote to Mlle. Bader requesting her authorization, and received a prompt
and kind reply. On the 18th of March Toru wrote again to this, her
solitary correspondent in the world of European literature, and her
letter, which has been preserved, shows that she had already descended
into the valley of the shadow of death:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Ma constitution n'est pas forte; j'ai contract&eacute; une toux
opini&acirc;tre, il y a plus de deux ans, qui ne me quitte point.
Cependant j'esp&egrave;re mettre la main &agrave; l'oeuvre bient&ocirc;t. Je ne peux
dire, mademoiselle, combien votre affection&mdash;car vous les aimez,
votre livre et votre lettre en t&eacute;moignent assez&mdash;pour mes
compatriotes et mon pays me touche; et je suis fi&egrave;re de pouvoir le
dire que les h&eacute;ro&iuml;nes de nos grandes &eacute;pop&eacute;es sont dignes de tout
honneur et de tout amour. Y a-t-il d'h&eacute;ro&iuml;ne plus touchante, plus
aimable que S&icirc;ta? Je ne le crois pas. Quand j'entends ma m&eacute;re
chanter, le soir, les vieux chants de notre pays, je pleure presque
toujours. La plainte de S&icirc;ta, quand, bannie pour la s&eacute;conde fois,
elle erre dans la vaste for&ecirc;t, seule, le d&eacute;sespoir et l'effroi dans
l'&acirc;me, est si path&eacute;tique qu'il n'y a personne, je crois, qui puisse
l'entendre sans verser des larmes. Je vous envois sous ce pli deux
petites traductions du Sanscrit, cette belle langue antique.
Malheureusement j'ai &eacute;t&eacute; oblig&eacute;e de faire cesser mes traductions de
Sanscrit, il y a six mois. Ma sant&eacute; ne me permet pas de les
continuer.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>These simple and pathetic words, in which the dying poetess pours out
her heart to the one friend she had, and that one gained too late, seem
as touching and as beautiful as any strain of Marceline Valmore's
immortal verse. In English poetry I do not remember anything that
exactly parallels their resigned melancholy. Before the month of March
was over, Toru had taken to her bed. Unable to write, she continued to
read, strewing her sick-room with the latest European books, and
entering with interest into the questions raised by the Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
Asiatique of Paris, in its printed Transactions. On the 30th of July she
wrote her last letter to Mlle. Clarisse Bader, and a month later, on
August 30, 1877, at the age of twenty-one years six months and
twenty-six days, she breathed her last in her father's house in
Maniktollah street, Calcutta.</p>

<p>In the first distraction of grief it seemed as though her unequalled
promise had been entirely blighted, and as though she would be
remembered only by her single book. But as her father examined her
papers, one completed work after another revealed itself. First a
selection from the sonnets of the Comte de Grammont, translated into
English, turned up, and was printed in a Calcutta magazine; then some
fragments of an English story, which were printed in another Calcutta
magazine. Much more important, however, than any of these was a complete
romance, written in French, being the identical story for which her
sister Aru had proposed to make the illustrations. In the meantime Toru
was no sooner dead than she began to be famous. In May, 1878, there
appeared a second edition of the &quot;Sheaf gleaned in French Fields,&quot; with
a touching sketch of her death, by her father; and in 1879 was
published, under the editorial care of Mlle. Clarisse Bader, the romance
of &quot;Le Journal de Mlle. D'Arvers,&quot; forming a handsome volume of 259
pages. This book, begun, as it appears, before the family returned from
Europe, and finished nobody knows when, is an attempt to describe scenes
from modern French society, but it is less interesting as an experiment
of the fancy, than as a revelation of the mind of a young Hindoo woman
of genius. The story is simple, clearly told, and interesting; the
studies of character have nothing French about them, but they are full
of vigor and originality. The description of the hero is most
characteristically Indian:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Il est beau en effet. Sa taille est haute, mais quelques-uns la
trouveraient mince; sa chevelure noire est boucl&eacute;e et tombe jusqu'&aacute;
la nuque; ses yeux noirs sont profonds et bien fendus; le front est
noble; la l&egrave;vre sup&eacute;rieure, couverte par une moustache naissante et
noire, est parfaitement model&eacute;e; son menton a quelque chose de
s&eacute;v&egrave;re; son teint est d'un blanc presque f&eacute;minin, ce qui d&eacute;note sa
haute naissance.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>In this description we seem to recognize some Surya or Soma of Hindoo
mythology, and the final touch, meaningless as applied to a European,
reminds us that in India whiteness of skin has always been a sign of
aristocratic birth, from the days when it originally distinguished the
conquering Aryas from the indigenous race of the Dasyous.</p>

<p>As a literary composition &quot;Mlle. D'Arvers&quot; deserves high commendation.
It deals with the ungovernable passion of two brothers for one placid
and beautiful girl, a passion which leads to fratricide and madness.
That it is a very melancholy and tragical story is obvious from this
brief sketch of its contents, but it is remarkable for coherence and
self-restraint no less than for vigor of treatment. Toru Dutt never
sinks to melodrama in the course of her extraordinary tale, and the
wonder is that she is not more often fantastic and unreal.</p>

<p>But we believe that the original English poems will be ultimately found
to constitute Toru's chief legacy to posterity. These ballads form the
last and most matured of her writings, and were left so far fragmentary
at her death that the fourth and fifth in her projected series of nine
were not to be discovered in any form among her papers. It is probable
that she had not even commenced them. Her father, therefore, to give a
certain continuity to the series, has filled up these blanks with two
stories from the &quot;Vishnupurana,&quot; which originally appeared respectively
in the &quot;Calcutta Review&quot; and in the &quot;Bengal Magazine.&quot; These are
interesting, but a little rude in form, and they have not the same
peculiar value as the rhymed octo-syllabic ballads. In these last we see
Toru no longer attempting vainly, though heroically, to compete with
European literature on its own ground, but turning to the legends of her
own race and country for inspiration. No modern Oriental has given us so
strange an insight into the conscience of the Asiatic as is presented in
the story of &quot;Preh&iacute;ad,&quot; or so quaint a piece of religious fancy as the
ballad of &quot;Jogadhya Uma.&quot; The poetess seems in these verses to be
chanting to herself those songs of her mother's race to which she always
turned with tears of pleasure. They breathe a Vedic solemnity and
simplicity of temper, and are singularly devoid of that littleness and
frivolity which seem, if we may judge by a slight experience, to be the
bane of modern India.</p>

<p>As to the merely technical character of these poems, it may be suggested
that in spite of much in them that is rough and inchoate, they show that
Toru was advancing in her mastery of English verse. Such a stanza as
this, selected out of many no less skilful, could hardly be recognized
as the work of one by whom the language was a late acquirement:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;What glorious trees! The sombre saul,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>On which the eye delights to rest&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The betel-nut, a pillar tall,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>With feathery branches for a crest&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The light-leaved tamarind spreading wide&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The pale faint-scented bitter neem,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The seemul, gorgeous as a bride,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>With flowers that have the ruby's gleam.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>In other passages, of course, the text reads like a translation from
some stirring ballad, and we feel that it gives but a faint and
discordant echo of the music welling in Toru's brain. For it must
frankly be confessed that in the brief May-day of her existence she had
not time to master our language as Blanco White did, or as Chamisso
mastered German. To the end of her days, fluent and graceful as she was,
she was not entirely conversant with English, especially with the
colloquial turns of modern speech. Often a very fine thought is spoiled
for hypercritical ears by the queer turn of expression which she has
innocently given to it. These faults are found to a much smaller degree
in her miscellaneous poems. Her sonnets seem to me to be of great
beauty, and her longer piece, entitled &quot;Our Casuarina Tree,&quot; needs no
apology for its rich and mellifluous numbers.</p>

<p>It is difficult to exaggerate when we try to estimate what we have lost
in the premature death of Toru Dutt. Literature has no honors which need
have been beyond the grasp of a girl who at the age of twenty-one, and
in languages separated from her own by so deep a chasm, had produced so
much of lasting worth. And her courage and fortitude were worthy of her
intelligence. Among &quot;last words&quot; of celebrated people, that which her
father has recorded, &quot;It is only the physical pain that makes me cry,&quot;
is not the least remarkable, or the least significant of strong
character. It was to a native of our island, and to one ten years senior
to Toru, to whom it was said, in words more appropriate, surely, to her
than to Oldham,</p>

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Still showed a quickness, and maturing time</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime.&quot;</span><br />
</div>

<p>That mellow sweetness was all that Toru lacked to perfect her as an
English poet, and of no other Oriental who has ever lived can the same
be said. When the history of the literature of our country comes to be
written, there is sure to be a page in it dedicated to this fragile
exotic blossom of song.</p>

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Spoke in a language sweet and plain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Here smiling Peace and Plenty dwell.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unconsciously he raised his cry,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Shell-bracelets ho!&quot; And at his voice</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Looked out the priest, with eager eye,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And made his heart at once rejoice.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Ho, <i>Sankha</i> pedler! Pass not by,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But step thou in, and share the food</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Just offered on our altar high,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>If thou art in a hungry mood.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Welcome are all to this repast!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The rich and poor, the high and low!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Come, wash thy feet, and break thy fast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then on thy journey strengthened go.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Oh thanks, good priest! Observance due</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And greetings! May thy name be blest!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I came on business, but I knew,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Here might be had both food and rest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Without a charge; for all the poor</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Ten miles around thy sacred shrine</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Know that thou keepest open door,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And praise that generous hand of thine:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But let my errand first be told,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>For bracelets sold to thine this day,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>So much thou owest me in gold,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Hast thou the ready cash to pay?</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The bracelets were enamelled&mdash;so</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The price is high.&quot;&mdash;&quot;How! Sold to mine?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Who bought them, I should like to know.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Thy daughter, with the large black eyne,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Now bathing at the marble ghat.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Loud laughed the priest at this reply,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;I shall not put up, friend, with that;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>No daughter in the world have I,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>An only son is all my stay;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Some minx has played a trick, no doubt,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But cheer up, let thy heart be gay.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Be sure that I shall find her out.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Nay, nay, good father, such a face</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Could not deceive, I must aver;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>At all events, she knows thy place,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>'And if my father should demur</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To pay thee'&mdash;thus she said&mdash;'or cry</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>He has no money, tell him straight</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The box vermilion-streaked to try,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>That's near the shrine,'&quot; &quot;Well, wait, friend, wait!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The priest said thoughtful, and he ran</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And with the open box came back,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Here is the price exact, my man,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>No surplus over, and no lack.</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How strange! how strange! Oh blest art thou</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>To have beheld her, touched her hand,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Before whom Vishnu's self must bow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And Brahma and his heavenly band!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Here have I worshipped her for years</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And never seen the vision bright;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Vigils and fasts and secret tears</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Have almost quenched my outward sight;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And yet that dazzling form and face</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>I have not seen, and thou, dear friend,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>To thee, unsought for, comes the grace,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>What may its purport be, and end?</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>How strange! How strange! Oh happy thou!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And couldst thou ask no other boon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Than thy poor bracelet's price? That brow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Resplendent as the autumn moon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Must have bewildered thee, I trow,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And made thee lose thy senses all.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A dim light on the pedler now</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Began to dawn; and he let fall</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His bracelet basket in his haste,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And backward ran the way he came;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>What meant the vision fair and chaste,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Whose eyes were they&mdash;those eyes of flame?</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Swift ran the pedler as a hind,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The old priest followed on his trace,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They reached the Ghat but could not find</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The lady of the noble face.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The birds were silent in the wood,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The lotus flowers exhaled a smell</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Faint, over all the solitude,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>A heron as a sentinel</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Stood by the bank. They called&mdash;in vain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>No answer came from hill or fell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The landscape lay in slumber's chain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>E'en Echo slept within her cell.</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Broad sunshine, yet a hush profound!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>They turned with saddened hearts to go;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then from afar there came a sound</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Of silver bells;&mdash;the priest said low,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;O Mother, Mother, deign to hear,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The worship-hour has rung; we wait</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In meek humility and fear.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Must we return home desolate?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Oh come, as late thou cam'st unsought,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Or was it but an idle dream?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Give us some sign if it was not,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>A word, a breath, or passing gleam.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sudden from out the water sprung</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>A rounded arm, on which they saw</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As high the lotus buds among</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>It rose, the bracelet white, with awe.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Then a wide ripple tost and swung</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The blossoms on that liquid plain,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And lo! the arm so fair and young</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Sank in the waters down again.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>They bowed before the mystic Power,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And as they home returned in thought,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Each took from thence a lotus flower</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>In memory of the day and spot.</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Years, centuries, have passed away,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And still before the temple shrine</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Descendants of the pedler pay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Shell-bracelets of the old design</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>As annual tribute. Much they own</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>In lands and gold&mdash;but they confess</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>From that eventful day alone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Dawned on their industry&mdash;success.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Absurd may be the tale I tell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Ill-suited to the marching times,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I loved the lips from which it fell,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>So let it stand among my rhymes.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In peace, at Dronacharjya's feet,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Magic and archery they learned,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A complex science, which we meet</span><br />

</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;And who art thou,&quot; the teacher said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;My science brave to learn so fain?</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Some young ones with large eyes and sweet</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Came close, and rubbed their foreheads smooth</span><br />

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Near Hastings, on the shingle-beach,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>We loitered at the time</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When ripens on the wall the peach,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The autumn's lovely prime.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Far off&mdash;the sea and sky seemed blent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The day was wholly done,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The distant town its murmurs sent,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Strangers&mdash;we were alone.</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We wandered slow; sick, weary, faint,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then one of us sat down,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No nature hers, to make complaint;&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The shadows deepened brown.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A lady past&mdash;she was not young,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But oh! her gentle face</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No painter-poet ever sung,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Or saw such saintlike grace.</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She passed us&mdash;then she came again,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Observing at a glance</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That we were strangers; one, in pain&mdash;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Then asked&mdash;Were we from France?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>We talked awhile&mdash;some roses red</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>That seemed as wet with tears,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>She gave my sister, and she said,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>God bless you both, my dears!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sweet were the roses&mdash;sweet and full,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And large as lotus flowers</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That in our own wide tanks we cull</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>To deck our Indian bowers.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But sweeter was the love that gave</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Those flowers to one unknown,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I think that He who came to save</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Blest, happy, may she be!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Her memory will not depart,</span><br />

<div class='poem'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Broad daylight, with a sense of weariness!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mine eyes were closed, but I was not asleep,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My hand was in my father's, and I felt</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His presence near me. Thus we often passed</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In silence, hour by hour. What was the need</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of interchanging words when every thought</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That in our hearts arose, was known to each,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And every pulse kept time? Suddenly there shone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A strange light, and the scene as sudden changed.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I was awake:&mdash;It was an open plain</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Illimitable&mdash;stretching, stretching&mdash;oh, so far!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And o'er it that strange light&mdash;a glorious light</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like that the stars shed over fields of snow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In a clear, cloudless, frosty winter night,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Only intenser in its brilliance calm.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And in the midst of that vast plain, I saw,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>For I was wide awake&mdash;it was no dream,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A tree with spreading branches and with leaves</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of divers kinds&mdash;dead silver and live gold,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Shimmering in radiance that no words may tell!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Beside the tree an Angel stood; he plucked</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A few small sprays, and bound them round my head.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Oh, the delicious touch of those strange leaves!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>No longer throbbed my brows, no more I felt</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The fever in my limbs&mdash;&quot;And oh,&quot; I cried,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>&quot;Bind too my father's forehead with these leaves.&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>One leaf the Angel took and therewith touched</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His forehead, and then gently whispered &quot;Nay!&quot;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Never, oh never had I seen a face</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>More beautiful than that Angel's, or more full</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of holy pity and of love divine.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Wondering I looked awhile&mdash;then, all at once</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Opened my tear-dimmed eyes&mdash;When lo! the light</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was gone&mdash;the light as of the stars when snow</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Lies deep upon the ground. No more, no more,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Was seen the Angel's face. I only found</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>My father watching patient by my bed,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And holding in his own, close-prest, my hand.</span><br />

<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>But not a sea of dull unvaried green,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Sharp contrasts of all colors here are seen;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The light-green graceful tamarinds abound</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Amid the mango clumps of green profound,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And palms arise, like pillars gray, between;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And o'er the quiet pools the seemuls lean,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Red&mdash;red, and startling like a trumpet's sound.</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But nothing can be lovelier than the ranges</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Of bamboos to the eastward, when the moon</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Looks through their gaps, and the white lotus changes</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Into a cup of silver. One might swoon</span><br />

<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like a huge Python, winding round and round</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>The rugged trunk, indented deep with scars</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Up to its very summit near the stars,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A creeper climbs, in whose embraces bound</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>No other tree could live. But gallantly</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The giant wears the scarf, and flowers are hung</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In crimson clusters all the boughs among,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Whereon all day are gathered bird and bee;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And oft at nights the garden overflows</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With one sweet song that seems to have no close,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Sung darkling from our tree, while men repose,</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When first my casement is wide open thrown</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>At dawn, my eyes delighted on it rest;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Sometimes, and most in winter&mdash;on its crest</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>A gray baboon sits statue-like alone</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Watching the sunrise; while on lower boughs</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>His puny offspring leap about and play;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And far and near kokilas hail the day;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And to their pastures wend our sleepy cows;</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And in the shadow, on the broad tank cast</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>By that hoar tree, so beautiful and vast,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>The water-lilies spring, like snow enmassed.</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>But not because of its magnificence</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Dear is the Casuarina to my soul:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Beneath it we have played; though years may roll,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>O sweet companions, loved with love intense,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>For your sakes, shall the tree be ever dear!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Blent with your images, it shall arise</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>In memory, till the hot tears blind mine eyes!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>What is that dirge-like murmur that I hear</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Like the sea breaking on a shingle-beach?</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>It is the tree's lament, an eerie speech,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That haply to the unknown land may reach.</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Unknown, yet well-known to the eye of faith!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Ah, I have heard that wail far, far away</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>In distant lands, by many a sheltered bay,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When slumbered in his cave the water-wraith</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And the waves gently kissed the classic shore</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Of France or Italy, beneath the moon,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>When earth lay tranced in a dreamless swoon:</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>And every time the music rose&mdash;before</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Mine inner vision rose a form sublime,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Thy form, O Tree, as in my happy prime</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>I saw thee, in my own loved native clime.</span><br />
</div>
<div class='stanza'><span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Therefore I fain would consecrate a lay</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Unto thy honor, Tree, beloved of those</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>Who now in blessed sleep, for aye, repose,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Dearer than life to me, alas! were they!</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>May'st thou be numbered when my days are done</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>With deathless trees&mdash;like those in Borrowdale,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>Under whose awful branches lingered pale</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 3em;'>&quot;Fear, trembling Hope, and Death, the skeleton,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>And Time, the shadow;&quot; and though weak the verse</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>That would thy beauty fain, oh fain rehearse,</span><br />
<span style='margin-left: 2em;'>May Love defend thee from Oblivion's curse.</span><br />

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
